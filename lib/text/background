DaggerFall is one of the most ambitious
games ever devised. This is no dungeon
hack, no bit of fluff with medieval trappings.
DaggerFall's world is twice the size of
Great Britain, filled with people, adveuntures,
and scenery as real as reality. This is 
a world designed to allow you to play the
Hero or the Villain...or anything in between.
DaggerFall is all your favorite books and 
movies wrapped up in one package.
Prepare to experience your new obsession.


&rNOT!&n Sorry, it's been a long time since Daggerfall has been that ritzy.
We are here for fun, and to have a good time too.  It is true that Daggerfall
is highly addictive, just ask the people who have spent 2000+ hours playing it
without closing their eyes.  And it is fun too, but what qualifications make
Daggerfall better than any of the other muds around?  It's all in the code.
And the people.  Just play it a while and you'll realize that this isn't an
overnight hack, Daggerfall has undergone many incarnations since it's original
starting in 1995.  The code is just different, this isn't your moms circlemud
however we try to keep it clean enough that if she was looking over your
shoulder you wouldn't be grounded :-).  Daggerfall has had a somewhat cult
following since 1998, and even after going down for a few months due to massive
(repeated) flaming; people were still anxious for it's return.  So to those of
you who would have wanted Daggerfall to stay down:

&R&vWERE BACK! WERE BACK! NEENER NEENER NEENER! NA NA NA NA NA! PBBBLBLBBLTTT!!!!!!!&n
 
Hopefully this run will be long and prosperous and I look forward to taking
Daggerfall to new heights.
