It's 1995.  Alicia Silverstone is Clueless, TLC was Chasing Waterfalls, 
Hugh Grant was arrested by cops for picking up a prostitute, Jenny McCarthy
was filiming the first episode of "Singled Out" for MTV, the Macerena hadn't
gone viral yet, and a MUD by the name of 'AAA Stockmud' which nearly
completely resembled the source of CircleMUD patch 11 was unleashed on a
mostly unconcerned public.  Over the next few years, many people would play,
some would spend thousands of hours playing, a lot of source code would get
changed, hundreds of thousands of innocent city guards would be slain, and a
new name would be chosen, &r"Daggerfall"&n.  This name was not intentionally
picked out of fandom for the game of the same name by Bethesda, but in was
selected by vote, and chosen in ignorance of the other game.  Nevertheless
Dagerfall (the MUD), lasted until 2002 when it's creater (Jaxom / Kevin Lohman)
would join the Navy.

15 years later.  The old code has been found.  The seals to the crypts opened.
The project open sourced on github.  The dragons have been unslain.  The bugs
remain hidden.  And the mud... renamed.  Welcome to Port 4000.  A mud for
those of us nostalgic for muds.  Like the flag that flies over our capital, it
may be taken down, but only to be cleaned and put back in it's true place. P4k
will continue to be maintained by Jaxom, and now, anyone who choses to help.
And it's not going down.  VIVE LA MUD!

The Creator,
  Jaxom (Kevin Lohman)
