Hello my fellow IMMortals.
 
 This handbook is filled with rules that you must follow, to prevent you
from getting into "trouble". If you follow the rules, and do what you are sup-
possed to, you will be rewarded.
 
Follow these rules:
 
&b**  THESE RULES MUST BE FOLLOWED OR YOU WILL BE FROZEN  **&n
1. You MUST treat the IMMortals and Mortals with &rrespect&n.
2. You will &rNOT retrieve a corpse&n for a Mortal unless you have permission.
3. You will &rNOT load or create&n ANY kind of eq for a Mortal.
4. You will &rNOT help a mortal find&n a piece of eq.
5. You will &rNOT help a mortal&n find or &rkill a Mobile&n.

&gReimbursements:&n
 
 The only time a IMMortal will give a reimbursement, is if the Mortal loses
their corpse in a crash or reboot. When you give a reimbursement,
put a message on the board that you did so, and why you did it. You will only
reimburse what a Mortal had before.
 
&gPromotions&n and &rDemotions&n:
 
 Promotions can be earned by completing tasks well and quickly, as well as good
orderly conduct while on the mud, and encouraging players to join as well as
stay on.  Demotions will occur when you have been failing to do your duties,
either by slacking off, or not logging in for an extended period of time.  Also
occasional demotions/promotions (temporary) will be given to give you the access
you need to complete the task that you are currently working on.
 
&rDeath Traps:&n
 
 If a mortal walks into a death trap, he/she will lose all items, like any
other death trap.  There is no prevention for these and you may NOT help
getting items back.  Death trap wanderrers will end up in room 1460 where
he/she may buy back the items at 2x the cost.  The MUD code should handle
all reimbs automatically.  Some items may be marked with "*" and this should
be ignored.  Again, no intervention is needed.

** The following rules have been written so IMMortal will not "cheat". These
rules are fairly easy to follow. Just follow the rules and you won't get in
any "trouble". I hope you have a good time in Daggerfall. Enjoy your stay.
And remember, ALWAYS follow the rules!  Have fun and be nice.
 
&r&vGOLDEN RULE TO KEEPING YOUR LEVEL - DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT JAXOM WOULD THINK IS BAD!&n
