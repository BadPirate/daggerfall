The best way to learn a mud is to learn it's commands, so to learn Daggerfalls
commands type:

&rcommands&n

Tough huh?  Then don't know what a command does or how it's used? Need help on 
it perhaps?  Then try:

&rhelp <&ncommand&r>&n

Again we try to fry your brains, and if your looking for the fun commands try:

&rsocial&n
