 himself." -- John Stuart Mill

Then Nicholl, using his own calculations, demonstrated that it was absolutely
impossible to give any object at all the velocity of 12,000 yards per
second.  And, algebra in hand, he maintained that even if such a velocity
could be attained, such a heavy projectile could never be lifted beyond the
limits of the Earth's atmosphere!  It would never reach even an altitude of
twenty miles.  And furthermore!  Even if such a speed could be attained,
even if it would suffice, the shell could not withstand the pressure of the 
gases produced by igniting 1,600,000 pounds of powder.  And even if it could
resist the pressure, it could not withstand the temperature, it would melt
as it left the Columbiad, and a red-hot rain would fall on the heads of the
foolish spectators.

"Do not fear death so much but rather the inadequate life."
		---Bertolt Brecht

"A liberal is someone who won't take his own side in an argument."


when i die, i'd like to go peacefully.
  in my sleep.
    like my grandfather.
not screaming,
  like the passengers in his car...

		"Time is only thing keeping everything from happening at
		once."

	"Giving money and power to government is like 
	 giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys."


I was Caesarian born.  You can't really tell that, although whenever
I leave a house, I go out through a window.

I kept a diary right after I was born.  Day 1: Still tired from the
move.  Day 2: Everyone talks to me like I'm an idiot.

I took the headlights off my car and put strobe lights on.  When I drive
at night, it looks like I'm the only one moving.

	A friend of mine once sent me a post card with a picture of the
	entire planet Earth taken from space.  On the back it said,
	"Wish you were here."

	It's a small world, but I wouldn't want to have to paint it.

	Cross country skiing is great if you live in a small country.

	I like to go to art museums and name the untitled paintings...
	Boy With Pail...  Kitten On Fire.

	I went to a general store.  They wouldn't let me buy anything
	specifically.

	I love to go shopping.  I love to freak out salespeople.  They
	ask me if they can help me, and I say, "Have you got anything
	I'd like?"  Then they ask me what size I need, and I say, "Extra
	medium."

	I bought my brother some gift-wrap for Christmas.  I took it to
	the Gift Wrap department and told them to wrap it, but in a
	different print so he would know when to stop unwrapping.

	In my house there's this light switch that doesn't do anything.
	Every so often I would flick it on and off just to check.
	Yesterday, I got a call from a woman in Germany.  She said, "Cut
	it out."

	Doing a little work around the house.  I put fake brick
	wallpaper over a real brick wall, just so I'd be the only one
	who knew.  People come over and I'm gonna say, "Go ahead, touch
	it...  it feels real."

	I hooked up my accelerator pedal in my car to my brake lights.
	I hit the gas, people behind me stop, and I'm gone.

	I watched the Indy 500, and I was thinking that if they left
	earlier they wouldn't have to go so fast.

	My neighbor has a circular driveway...  he can't get out.

	I used to work in a fire hydrant factory.  You couldn't park
	anywhere near the place.

	I have an answering machine in my car.  It says, "I'm home now.
	But leave a message and I'll call when I'm out."

	I saw a sign:  "Rest Area 25 Miles".  That's pretty big.  Some
	people must be really tired.

	A cop stopped me for speeding.  He said, "Why were you going so
	fast?"  I said, "See this thing my foot is on?  It's called an
	accelerator.  When you push down on it, it sends more gas to the
	engine.  The whole car just takes right off.  And see this
	thing?  This steers it."

	I was going 70 miles an hour and got stopped by a cop who said,
	"Do you know the speed limit is 55 miles per hour?"  "Yes,
	officer, but I wasn't going to be out that long..."

	The judge asked, "What do you plead?"  I said, "Insanity, your
	honour, who in their right mind would park in the passing lane?"

	When I get real bored, I like to drive downtown and get a great
	parking spot, then sit in my car and count how many people ask
	me if I'm leaving.

	I hate it when my foot falls asleep during the day because that
	means it's going to be up all night.

	When I woke up this morning, my girlfriend asks me, "Did you 
	sleep well?"  I said, No, I made a few mistakes."

	I was trying to daydream, but my mind kept wandering.

	There's a fine line between fishing and standing on the shore
	looking like an idiot.

	I bought a dog the other day...  I named him Stay.  It's fun to
	call him...  "Come here, Stay!  Come here, Stay!"  He went
	insane.  Now he just ignores me and keeps typing.

	I bought some powdered water, but I don't know what to add to it.

	When I was little, my grandfather used to make me stand in a
	closet for five minutes without moving.  He said it was elevator
	practice.

	When I was a little kid we had a sand box.  It was a quicksand
	box.  I was an only child...  eventually.

	My school colors were clear.  We used to say, "I'm not naked,
	I'm in the band."

	When I have a kid, I want to buy one of those strollers for
	twins.  Then put the kid in and run around, looking frantic.
	When he gets older, I'd tell him he used to have a brother, but
	he didn't obey.

	Right now I'm having amnesia and deja vu at the same time.  I
	think I've forgotten this before.

	I was reading the dictionary.  I thought it was a poem about
	everything.

	What's another word for Thesaurus?

	Why is the alphabet in that order?  Is it because of that song?

	I'm writing a book.  I've got the page numbers done.

	After they make styrofoam, what do they ship it in?
	Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time.
	I made wine out of raisins so I wouldn't have to wait for it to age.
	I saw a subliminal advertising executive, but only for a second.
	If you saw a heat wave, would you wave back?
	If you were going to shoot a mime, would you use a silencer?
	You can't have everything.  Where would you put it?

	The other day when I was walking through the woods, I saw a
	rabbit standing in front of a candle making shadows of people on
	a tree.

	It doesn't matter what temperature the room is, it's always room
	temperature.

	I have the world's largest collection of seashells.  I keep it
	on all the beaches of the world...  perhaps you've seen it.

	I filled out an application that said, "In Case Of Emergency
	Notify".  I wrote "Doctor"...  What's my mother going to do?

	If toast always lands butter-side down, and cats always land on
	their feet, what happen if you strap toast on the back of a cat
	and drop it?

	I have a map of the United States...  actual size.  It says,
	"Scale:  1 mile = 1 mile."  I spent last summer folding it.  I
	also have a full-size map of the world.  I hardly ever unroll it.

	Do you think that when they asked George Washington for ID that
	he just whipped out a quarter?

	I had some eyeglasses.  I was walking down the street when
	suddenly the prescription ran out.

	When I turned two I was really anxious, because I'd doubled my
	age in a year.  I thought, if this keeps up, by the time I'm six
	I'll be ninety.

	Sponges grow in the ocean.  That just kills me.  I wonder how
	much deeper the ocean would be if that didn't happen.

	Smoking cures weight problems...  eventually...

	I took a course in speed waiting.  Now I can wait an hour in
	only ten minutes.

	Is "tired old cliche" one?

	I heard that in relativity theory space and time are the same
	thing.  Einstein discovered this when he kept showing up three
	miles late for his meetings.

	Wrote my own communications software in LISP.  Got a phone bill
	for a thousand dollars.  My computer keeps calling itself.

	If a word in the dictionary were misspelled, how would we know?

	Why doesn't the fattest man in the world become a hockey goalie?

	It takes money to make money because you have to copy the design
	exactly.

	A man committed suicide by overdosing on decongestant tablets.
	All they found was a pile of dust.

Programming is an endless race between the software engineer, who seeks to 
design increasingly idiot-proof code, and the Universe, which strives to 
produce even bigger idiots.

If the opposite of "pro" is "con", what is the opposite of "progress"?

The lottery is just a tax on people who are bad at math.

	"I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing
that people often say about Him: "I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great 
moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God." That is the one 
thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of 
things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher.  He would either be a 
lunatic--on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg--or else he 
would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, 
and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut 
Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can 
fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any 
patronising nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left 
that open to us. He did not intend to."

Perhaps they are." 
			--Ralph Waldo Emerson
	"Five senses; an incurably abstract intellect; a haphazardly selective
memory; a set of preconceptions and assumptions so numerous that I can never 
examine more than minority of them - never become conscious of them all.  How 
much of total reality can such an apparatus let through?"
				--C. S. Lewis
	"Most people are other people.  Their thoughts are someone else's
opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation."

"... Once you're safely in the mall, you should tie your children to you
 with ropes so the other shoppers won't try to buy them. Holiday

 them to see Santa Claus; that ought to shut them up."

"All things dull and ugly, All creatures short and squat,
 	All things rude and nasty, The Lord God made the lot;
 Each little snake that poisons, Each little wasp that stings,
	He made their brutish venom, He made their horrid wings.
 All things sick and cancerous, All evil great and small,
	All things foul and dangerous, The Lord God made them all.
 Each nasty little hornet, Each beastly little squid.
	Who made the spikey urchin? Who made the sharks?  He did.
 All things scabbed and ulcerous, All pox both great and small.
	Putrid, foul and gangrenous, The Lord God made them all."

"These days the necessities of life cost you about three times what they 
 used to, and half the time they aren't even fit to drink."

They [District Attorneys] learn in District Attorney School that there
are two sure-fire ways to get a lot of favorable publicity:
(1) Go down and raid all the lockers in the local high school and
    confiscate 53 marijuana cigarettes and put them in a pile and hold
    a press conference where you announce that they have a street value
    of $850 million.  These raids never fail, because ALL high schools,
    including brand-new, never-used ones, have at least 53 marijuana
    cigarettes in the lockers.  As far as anyone can tell, the locker
    factory puts them there.
(2) Raid an "adult book store" and hold a press conference where you
    announce you are charging the owner with 850 counts of being a
    piece of human sleaze.  This also never fails, because you always
    get a conviction.  A juror at a pornography trial is not about to
    state for the record that he finds nothing obscene about a movie
    where actors engage in sexual activities with live snakes and a
    fire extinguisher.  He is going to convict the bookstore owner, and
    vote for the death penalty just to make sure nobody gets the wrong
    impression.

"Yes, that was Richard Nixon.  He used to be President.  When he left
the White House, the Secret Service would count the silverware."

STEVEN WRIGHT JOKES

	--- big picture ---

	A friend of mine once sent me a post card with a picture of the
	entire planet Earth taken from space.  On the back it said,
	"Wish you were here."

	I'm moving to Mars next week, so if you have any boxes...

	It's a small world, but I wouldn't want to have to paint it.

	Cross country skiing is great if you live in a small country.

	--- banks ---

	I went to the bank and asked to borrow a cup of money.  They
	said, "What for?"  I said, "I'm going to buy some sugar."

	I saw a bank that said "24 Hour Banking", but I don't have that
	much time.

	--- museums ---

	I went to the museum where they had all the heads and arms from
	the statues that are in all the other museums.

	I like to go to art museums and name the untitled paintings...
	Boy With Pail...  Kitten On Fire.

	--- restaurants ---

	I went to a restaurant that serves "breakfast at any time".  So
	I ordered French Toast during the Renaissance.

	I went to this restaurant last night that was set up like a big
	buffet in the shape of an Ouija board.  You'd think about what
	kind of food you want, and the table would move across the floor
	to it.

	There's a pizza place near where I live that sells only slices.
	in the back you can see a guy tossing a triangle in the air.

	--- stores ---

	I went to a general store.  They wouldn't let me buy anything
	specifically.

	I worked in a health food store once.  A guy came in and asked
	me, "If I melt dry ice, can I take a bath without getting wet?"

	I went to a 7-11 and asked for a 2x4 and a box of 3x5's.  The
	clerk said, "ten-four."

	I was in the grocery store.  I saw a sign that said "pet
	supplies".  So I did.  Then I went outside and saw a sign that
	said "compact cars".

	I went down the street to the 24-hour grocery.  When I got
	there, the guy was locking the front door.  I said, "Hey, the
	sign says you're open 24 hours."  He said, "Yes, but not in a
	row."

	I love to go shopping.  I love to freak out salespeople.  They
	ask me if they can help me, and I say, "Have you got anything
	I'd like?"  Then they ask me what size I need, and I say, "Extra
	medium."

	I saw a small bottle of cologne and asked if it was for sale.
	She said, "It's free with purchase."  I asked her if anyone
	bought anything today.

	I met this wonderful girl at Macy's.  She was buying clothes and
	I was putting Slinkies on the escalator.

	There was a power outage at a department store yesterday.
	Twenty people were trapped on the escalators.

	I bought my brother some gift-wrap for Christmas.  I took it to
	the Gift Wrap department and told them to wrap it, but in a
	different print so he would know when to stop unwrapping.

	--- appliances ---

	For my birthday I got a humidifier and a de-humidifier...  I put
	them in the same room and let them fight it out.

	Ever notice how irons have a setting for *permanent* press?  I
	don't get it...

	I couldn't find the remote control to the remote control.

	I invented the cordless extension cord.

	--- telephones ---

	I saw a close friend of mine the other day...  He said,
	"Stephen, why haven't you called me?"  I said, "I can't call
	everyone I want.  My new phone has no five on it."  He said,
	"How long have you had it?"  I said, "I don't know...  my
	calendar has no sevens on it."

	I plugged my phone in where the blender used to be.  I called
	someone.  They went "Aaaaahhhh..."

	Today I dialed a wrong number...  The other person said,
	"Hello?"  and I said, "Hello, could I speak to Joey?"...  They
	said, "Uh...  I don't think so...  he's only 2 months old."  I
	said, "I'll wait."

	I don't like the sound of my phone ringing so I put my phone
	inside my fish tank.  I can't hear it, but every time I get a
	call I see the fish go like this <<<>>><<>><<<<.  I go down to
	the pet store -- "Gimme another ten guppies, I got a lotta calls
	yesterday."

	--- apartments ---

	My roommate got a pet elephant.  Then it got lost.  It's in the
	apartment somewhere.

	I installed a skylight in my apartment....  The people who live
	above me are furious!

	All of the people in my building are insane.  The guy above me
	designs synthetic hairballs for ceramic cats.  The lady across
	the hall tried to rob a department store...  with a pricing
	gun...  She said, "Give me all of the money in the vault, or I'm
	marking down everything in the store."

	While I was gone, somebody rearranged on the furniture in my
	bedroom.  They put it in *exactly* the same place it was.  When
	I told my roommate, he said:  "Do I know you?"

	--- houses ---

	In my house there's this light switch that doesn't do anything.
	Every so often I would flick it on and off just to check.
	Yesterday, I got a call from a woman in Germany.  She said, "Cut
	it out."

	Doing a little work around the house.  I put fake brick
	wallpaper over a real brick wall, just so I'd be the only one
	who knew.  People come over and I'm gonna say, "Go ahead, touch
	it...  it feels real."

	In my house on the ceilings I have paintings of the rooms
	above...  so I never have to go upstairs.

	One time the power went out in my house and I had to use the
	flash on my camera to see my way around.  I made a sandwich and
	took fifty pictures of my face.  The neighbors thought there was
	lightning in my house.

	All the plants in my house are dead -- I shot them last night.
	I was teasing them by watering them with ice cubes.

	I have a microwave fireplace in my house...  The other night I
	laid down in front of the fire for the evening in two minutes.

	Winny and I lived in a house that ran on static electricity...
	If you wanted to run the blender, you had to rub balloons on
	your head.  If you wanted to cook, you had to pull off a sweater
	real quick.

	I bought a house, on a one-way dead-end road.  I don't know how
	I got there.

	I went to the hardware store and bought some used paint.  It was
	in the shape of a house.  I also bought some batteries, but they
	weren't included.  So I had to buy them again.

	My house is made out of balsa wood, so when I want to scare the
	neighborhood kids I lift it over my head and tell them to get
	out of my yard or I'll throw it at them.

	The other night I came home late, and tried to unlock my house
	with my car keys.  I started the house up.  So, I drove it
	around for a while.  I was speeding, and a cop pulled me over.
	He asked where I lived.  I said, "right here, officer".  Later,
	I parked it on the freeway, got out, and yelled at all the cars,
	"Get out of my driveway!"

	My house is on the median strip of a highway.  You don't really
	notice, except I have to leave the driveway doing 60 MPH.

	--- cars and driving ---

	For a while I didn't have a car...  I had a helicopter...  no
	place to park it, so I just tied it to a lamp post and left it
	running...  (slow glance upward)

	I hooked up my accelerator pedal in my car to my brake lights.
	I hit the gas, people behind me stop, and I'm gone.

	I replaced the headlights in my car with strobe lights, so it
	looks like I'm the only one moving.

	I play the harmonica.  The only way I can play is if I get my
	car going really fast, and stick it out the window.

	I put a new engine in my car, but forgot to take the old one
	out.  Now my car goes 500 miles per hour.  The harmonica sounds
	*amazing*.

	I watched the Indy 500, and I was thinking that if they left
	earlier they wouldn't have to go so fast.

	I had to stop driving my car for a while...  the tires got
	dizzy.

	My neighbor has a circular driveway...  he can't get out.

	I used to work in a fire hydrant factory.  You couldn't park
	anywhere near the place.

	I have an answering machine in my car.  It says, "I'm home now.
	But leave a message and I'll call when I'm out."

	Last year we drove across the country.  We switched on the
	driving...  every half mile...  We had one cassette tape to
	listen to on the entire trip...  I don't remember what it was.

	I saw a sign:  "Rest Area 25 Miles".  That's pretty big.  Some
	people must be really tired.

	A cop stopped me for speeding.  He said, "Why were you going so
	fast?"  I said, "See this thing my foot is on?  It's called an
	accelerator.  When you push down on it, it sends more gas to the
	engine.  The whole car just takes right off.  And see this
	thing?  This steers it."

	I was going 70 miles an hour and got stopped by a cop who said,
	"Do you know the speed limit is 55 miles per hour?"  "Yes,
	officer, but I wasn't going to be out that long..."

	One time a cop pulled me over for running a stop sign.  He said,
	"Didn't you see the stop sign?"  I said, "Yeah, but I don't
	believe everything I read."

	I got my driver's license photo taken out of focus on purpose.
	Now when I get pulled over the cop looks at it (moving it nearer
	and farther, trying to see it clearly)...  and says, "Here, you
	can go."

	The judge asked, "What do you plead?"  I said, "Insanity, your
	honour, who in their right mind would park in the passing lane?"

	When I get real bored, I like to drive downtown and get a great
	parking spot, then sit in my car and count how many people ask
	me if I'm leaving.

	Yesterday I parked my car in a tow-away zone...  when I came
	back the entire area was missing.

	--- sleeping ---

	I can remember the first time I had to go to sleep.  Mom said,
	"Steven, time to go to sleep."  I said, "But I don't know how."
	She said, "It's real easy.  Just go down to the end of tired and
	hang a left."  So I went down to the end of tired, and just out
	of curiosity I hung a right.  My mother was there, and she said
	"I thought I told you to go to sleep."

	I hate it when my foot falls asleep during the day because that
	means it's going to be up all night.

	When I woke up this morning my girlfriend asked me, "Did you
	sleep good?"  I said, "No, I made a few mistakes."

	I was trying to daydream, but my mind kept wandering.

	One night I walked home very late and fell asleep in somebody's
	satellite dish.  My dreams were showing up on TV's all over the
	world.

	My girlfriend does her nails with white-out.  When she's asleep,
	I go over there and write misspelled words on them.

	--- socks ---

	I got up one morning and couldn't find my socks, so I called
	Information.  She said, "Hello, Information."  I said, "I can't
	find my socks."  She said, "They're behind the couch."  And they
	were!

	I went into this bar and sat down next to a pretty girl.  She
	looked at me and said, "Hey, you have two different colored
	socks on."  I said, "Yeah, I know, but to me they're the same
	because I go by thickness."

	--- records ---

	I bought a self learning record to learn Spanish.  I turned it
	on and went to sleep; the record got stuck.  The next day I
	could only stutter in Spanish.

	I was going to tape some records onto a cassette, but I got the
	wires backwards.  I erased all of the records.  When I returned
	them to my friend, he said, "Hey, these records are all blank."

	--- fishing ---

	Last year I went fishing with Salvador Dali.  He was using a
	dotted line.  He caught every other fish.

	There's a fine line between fishing and standing on the shore
	looking like an idiot.

	--- dogs ---

	I bought a dog the other day...  I named him Stay.  It's fun to
	call him...  "Come here, Stay!  Come here, Stay!"  He went
	insane.  Now he just ignores me and keeps typing.

	I put contact lenses in my dog's eyes.  They had little pictures
	of cats on them.  Then I took one out and he ran around in
	circles.

	The other day, I was walking my dog around my building...  on
	the ledge.  Some people are afraid of heights.  Not me, I'm
	afraid of widths.

	I spilled spot remover on my dog.  He's gone now.

	--- chemistry ---

	If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the
	precipitate.

	(Referring to a glass of water:)  I mixed this myself.  Two
	parts H, one part O.  I don't trust anybody!

	They say we're 98% water.  We're that close to drowning...
	(picks up his glass of water from the stool)...  I like to live
	on the edge...

	I bought some powdered water, but I don't know what to add to it.

	--- childhood ---

	I was born by Caesarian section...  but not so you'd notice.
	It's just that when I leave a house, I go out through the
	window.

	When I was little, my grandfather used to make me stand in a
	closet for five minutes without moving.  He said it was elevator
	practice.

	I didn't get a toy train like the other kids.  I got a toy
	subway instead.  You couldn't see anything, but every now and
	then you'd hear this rumbling noise go by.

	When I was a kid, I went to the store and asked the guy, "Do you
	have any toy train schedules?"

	When I was a little kid we had a sand box.  It was a quicksand
	box.  I was an only child...  eventually.

	When I was five years old I was on a merry go round.  There was
	a gunshot nearby.  The horses stampeded.  There I was running
	down the street on a purple wooden horse.

	When I was eight, I played Little League.  I was on first; I
	stole third; I went straight across.  Earlier that week, I
	learned that the shortest distance between two points was a
	direct line.  I took advantage of that knowledge.

	I used to own an ant farm but had to give it up.  I couldn't
	find tractors small enough to fit it.

	My friend Winnie is a procrastinator.  He didn't get his
	birthmark until he was eight years old.

	My school colors were clear.  We used to say, "I'm not naked,
	I'm in the band."

	When I have a kid, I want to buy one of those strollers for
	twins.  Then put the kid in and run around, looking frantic.
	When he gets older, I'd tell him he used to have a brother, but
	he didn't obey.

	Babies don't need a vacation, but I still see them at the
	beach...  it pisses me off!  I'll go over to a little baby and
	say, "What are you doing here?  You haven't worked a day in your
	life!"

	My friend has a baby.  I'm recording all the noises he makes so
	later I can ask him what he meant.

	--- not-all-there ---

	You know how it is when you're reading a book and falling
	asleep, you're reading, reading...  and all of a sudden you
	notice your eyes are closed?  I'm like that all the time.

	Well, you know when you're rocking in a rocking chair, and you
	go so far that you almost fall over backwards, but at the last
	instant you catch yourself?  That's how I feel all the time.

	Right now I'm having amnesia and deja vu at the same time.  I
	think I've forgotten this before.

	Lots of comedians have people they try to mimic.  I mimic my
	shadow.

	I got a new shadow.  I had to get rid of the other one...  it
	wasn't doing what I was doing.

	If you can't hear me, it's because I'm in parentheses.

	Four years ago...  no, it was yesterday.
	Today I...  No, that wasn't me.
	Sometimes I...  No, I don't.

	--- suicide ---

	I once tried to commit suicide by jumping off a building...  I
	changed my mind at the last minute, so I just flipped over and
	landed on my feet.  Two little kittens nearby saw what happened
	and one turned to the other and said, "See, that's how it's
	done."

	I was going to commit suicide the other day, but I must not have
	been serious because I brought a beach towel.

	--- books ---

	I was reading the dictionary.  I thought it was a poem about
	everything.

	What's another word for Thesaurus?

	Why is the alphabet in that order?  Is it because of that song?

	My grandfather invented Cliff's Notes.  It all started back in
	1912...  Well, to make a long story short ...

	I'm writing a book.  I've got the page numbers done.

	I'm writing an unauthorized autobiography.

	I wrote a few children's books...  not on purpose.

	--- miscellaneous one-liners ---

	After they make styrofoam, what do they ship it in?
	Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time.
	I broke my arm trying to fold a bed.  It wasn't the kind that folds.
	I like to reminisce with people I don't know.
	I like to skate on the other side of the ice.
	I lost a button hole today.
	I made wine out of raisins so I wouldn't have to wait for it to age.
	I saw a man with a wooden leg, and a real foot.
	I saw a subliminal advertising executive, but only for a second.
	I saw a tree fall in the woods, and I didn't hear it.
	I took a baby shower.
	I used to be a bartender at the Betty Ford Clinic.
	I was skydiving horizontally.
	I washed mud, off of mud.
	I'm so hyper...  (said with a very dull voice)
	If you saw a heat wave, would you wave back?
	If you were going to shoot a mime, would you use a silencer?
	My VCR flashes 01:35, 01:35, 01:35, ...
	"So, do you live around here often?"
	Women...  can't live with 'em...  can't shoot 'em.
	You can't have everything.  Where would you put it?

	--- miscellaneous ---

	My dental hygienist is cute.  Every time I visit, I eat a whole
	package of Oreo cookies while waiting in the lobby.  Sometimes
	she has to cancel the rest of the afternoon's appointments.

	One day I got on the usual bus, and when I stepped in, I saw the
	most gorgeous blond Chinese girl...  I sat beside her.  I said,
	"Hi," and she said, "Hi," and then I said, "Nice day, isn't
	it?," and she said, "I saw my analyst today and he says I have a
	problem."  So I asked, "What's the problem?"  She replied, "I
	can't tell you.  I don't even know you..."  I said, "Well
	sometimes it's good to tell your problems to a perfect stranger
	on a bus."  So she said, "Well, my analyst said I'm a
	nymphomaniac and I only like Jewish cowboys...  by the way, my
	name is Denise."  I said, "Hello, Denise.  My name is Bucky
	Goldstein..."

	I got into an elevator at work and this man followed in after
	me...  I pushed "1" and he just stood there...  I said, "Hi,
	where you going?"  He said, "Phoenix."  So I pushed Phoenix.  A
	few seconds later the doors opened, two tumbleweeds blew in...
	we were in downtown Phoenix.  I looked at him and said, "You
	know, you're the kind of guy I want to hang around with."  We
	got into his car and drove out to his shack in the desert.  Then
	the phone rang.  He said, "You get it."  I picked it up and
	said, "Hello?"...  The other side said, "Is this Steven
	Wright?"...  I said, "Yes..."  The guy said, "Hi, I'm Mr.
	Jones, the student loan director from your bank.  It seems you
	have missed your last 17 payments, and the university you
	attended said that they received none of the $17,000 we loaned
	you.  We would just like to know what happened to the money?"  I
	said, "Mr.  Jones, I'll give it to you straight.  I gave all of
	the money to my friend Slick, and with it he built a nuclear
	weapon...  and I would appreciate it if you never called me
	again."

	The other day when I was walking through the woods, I saw a
	rabbit standing in front of a candle making shadows of people on
	a tree.

	I had a dream that all the victims of The Pill came back...
	boy, were they mad!

	The Stones, I love the Stones.  I watch them whenever I can.
	Fred, Barney...

	I like to fill my tub up with water, then turn the shower on and
	act like I'm in a submarine that's been hit.

	It doesn't matter what temperature the room is, it's always room
	temperature.

	I have two very rare photographs.  One is a picture of Houdini
	locking his keys in his car.  The other is a rare photograph of
	Norman Rockwell beating up a child.

	I have the world's largest collection of seashells.  I keep it
	on all the beaches of the world...  perhaps you've seen it.

	I went to the eye doctor and found out I needed glasses for
	reading.  So, I got some flip-up contact lenses.

	Winny would spend all of his time practicing limbo.  He got
	pretty good.  He could go under a rug.

	I filled out an application that said, "In Case Of Emergency
	Notify".  I wrote "Doctor"...  What's my mother going to do?

	I had just received my degree in Calcium Anthropology...  the
	study of milkmen.

	He was a multi-millionaire.  Wanna know how he made all of his
	money?  He designed the little diagrams that tell which way to
	put batteries in.

	I stayed up all night playing poker with tarot cards.  I got a
	full house and four people died.

	A friend of mine is into Voodoo Acupuncture.  You don't have to
	go.  You'll just be walking down the street, and...
	ooooohhhhhh, that's much better...

	I had a friend who was a clown.  When he died, all his friends
	went to the funeral in one car.

	My girlfriend and I went on a picnic.  I don't know how she did
	it, but she got poison ivy on the brain.  When it itched, the
	only way she could scratch it was to think about sandpaper.

	I'd like to sing you a song now about my old girlfriend.  It's
	called, "They'll Find Her When the Leaves Blow Away 'Cause I'm
	Not Raking 'Til Spring."

	My girlfriend asked me how long I was going to be gone on this
	tour.  I said, "the whole time."

	It's a good thing we have gravity, or else when birds died
	they'd just stay right up there.  Hunters would be all confused.

	The sun got confused about daylight savings time.  It rose
	twice.  Everything had two shadows.

	I wrote a song, but I can't read music so I don't know what it
	is.  Every once in a while I'll be listening to the radio and I
	say, "I think I might have written that."

	When I was crossing the border into Canada, they asked if I had
	any firearms with me.  I said, "Well, what do you need?"

	Some people think George is weird, because he has sideburns
	behind his ears.  I think George is weird, because he has false
	teeth.  with braces on them.  George is a radio announcer, and
	when he walks under a bridge...  you can't hear him talk.

	If toast always lands butter-side down, and cats always land on
	their feet, what happen if you strap toast on the back of a cat
	and drop it?

	I saw a sign at a gas station.  It said "help wanted".  There
	was another sign below it that said "self service".  So I hired
	myself.  Then I made myself the boss.  I gave myself a raise.  I
	paid myself.  Then I quit.

	Every so often, I like to go to the window, look up, and smile
	for a satellite picture.

	I used to be an airline pilot.  I got fired because I kept
	locking the keys in the plane.  They caught me on an 80 foot
	stepladder with a coathanger.

	In Vegas, I got into a long argument with the man at the
	roulette wheel over what I considered to be an odd number.

	I have a map of the United States...  actual size.  It says,
	"Scale:  1 mile = 1 mile."  I spent last summer folding it.  I
	also have a full-size map of the world.  I hardly ever unroll it.

	Do you think that when they asked George Washington for ID that
	he just whipped out a quarter?

	I want to get a tatoo of myself on my entire body, only 2"
	taller.

	I'm kinda tired.  I was up all night trying to round off
	infinity.  Then I got bored and went out and painted passing
	lines on curved roads.

	This is my impression of a bowling ball...  (drags the mike
	along the floor, then lifts it)...  gutter...

	I was watching the Superbowl with my 92 year old grandfather.
	The team scored a touchdown.  They showed the instant replay.
	He thought they scored another one.  I was gonna tell him, but I
	figured the game *he* was watching was better.

	I owed my friend George $25.  For about three weeks I owed it to
	him.  The whole time I had the money on me -- he didn't know it.
	Walking through New York City, 2:30 in the morning and got held
	up.  He said, "Gimme all your money."  I said, "Wait a minute."
	I said, "George, here's the 25 dollars I owe you."  The the
	thief took a thousand dollars out of his own money and he gave
	it to George.  At gunpoint made me borrow a thousand dollars
	from George.
 
	Subject:  FAKE Steven Wright jokes	[original; edited]

	Here are my categories, with examples (his):

	ENGLISH:

	I had some eyeglasses.  I was walking down the street when
	suddenly the prescription ran out.

	I got food poisoning today.  I don't know when I'll use it.

	REVERSALS / SYMMETRY:

	I put my air conditioner in backwards.  It got cold outside.
	The weatherman on TV was confused.  "It was supposed to be hot
	today."

	I was in a job interview and I opened a book and started
	reading.  Then I said to the guy, "Let me ask you a question.
	If you are in a spaceship that is traveling at the speed of
	light, and you turn on the headlights, does anything happen?"
	He said, "I don't know."  I said, "I don't want your job."

	SIMILARITY / ANALOGY:

	I was in the first submarine.  Instead of a periscope, they had
	a kaleidoscope.  "We're surrounded."

	I went camping and borrowed a circus tent by mistake.  I didn't
	notice until I got it set up.  People complained because they
	couldn't see the lake.

	WRONG METHODS / REASONS / MECHANISMS:

	When I turned two I was really anxious, because I'd doubled my
	age in a year.  I thought, if this keeps up, by the time I'm six
	I'll be ninety.

	Sponges grow in the ocean.  That just kills me.  I wonder how
	much deeper the ocean would be if that didn't happen.

	IDEMPOTENCE / ADDITION OF EFFECTS (REPETITION):

	I put instant coffee in a microwave oven and almost went back in
	time.

	It's a fine night to have an evening.

	Even snakes are afraid of snakes.

	SELF:

	I can't stop thinking like this.

	This isn't all true.

	You know how it is when you're walking up the stairs, and you
	get to the top, and you think there's one more step?  I'm like
	that all the time.

	NAAAHH:

	I put hardwood floors on top of wall-to-wall carpet.

	Tinsel is really snakes' mirrors.

	TRIVIALIZATION:

	Two babies were born on the same day at the same hospital.  They
	lay there and looked at each other.  Their families came and
	took them away.  Eighty years later, by a bizarre coincidence,
	they lay in the same hospital, on their deathbeds, next to each
	other.  One of them looked at the other and said, "So.  What did
	you think?"

	My grandfather gave me a watch.  It doesn't have any hands or
	numbers.  He says it's very accurate.  I asked him what time it
	was.  You can guess what he told me.

	These are "fake" Steve Wright sayings, by Rod Schmidt:

	I planted some bird seed.  A bird came up.  Now I don't know
	what to feed it.

	I made a chocolate cake with white chocolate.  Then I took it to
	a potluck.  I stood in line for some cake.  They said, "Do you
	want white cake or chocolate cake?"  I said, "Yes".

	I'm good, she'll give me the other one next year.

	I eat swiss cheese from the inside out.

	I had amnesia once or twice.

	I bought a million lottery tickets.  I won a dollar.

	I got a chain letter by fax.  It's very simple.  You just fax a

	My friend Sam has one leg.  I went to his house.  I couldn't go
	up the stairs.

	The sun never sets on the British Empire.  But it rises every
	morning.  The sky must get awfully crowded.

	I brought a mirror to Lovers' Lane.  I told everybody I'm
	Narcissus.

	I busted a mirror and got seven years bad luck, but my lawyer
	thinks he can get me five.

	You know how it is when you decide to lie and say the check is
	in the mail, and then you remember it really is?  I'm like that
	all the time.

	How many people does it take to change a searchlight bulb?

	The sky already fell.  Now what?

	I wear my heart on my sleeve.  I wear my liver on my pant leg.

	I still have my Christmas Tree.  I looked at it today.  Sure
	enough, I couldn't see any forests.

	If you can wave a fan, and you can wave a club, can you wave a
	fan club?

	When I was in boy scouts, I slipped on the ice and hurt my
	ankle.  A little old lady had to help me across the street.

	If you write the word "monkey" a million times, do you start to
	think you're Shakespeare?

	Smoking cures weight problems...  eventually...

	I had fried octopus last night.  You have to be really quiet

	for?"

	I xeroxed my watch.  Now I have time to spare.

	experiment, and nobody else shows up, and you think maybe that's

	"What are you making?"  "A salt lick."

	My friend Sally is a nudist.  I went to her house.  The closets
	have no doors.  The walls are covered with see-through
	wallpaper.

	Sally plays strip poker.  Whenever she loses, she has to put
	something on.

	The sky is falling...  no, I'm tipping over backwards.

	Droughts are because god didn't pay his water bill.

	Is "tired old cliche" one?

	If you had a million Shakespeares, could they write like a
	monkey?

	if you tell a joke in the forest, but nobody laughs, was it a
	joke?

	It only rains straight down.  God doesn't do windows.

	When I get bored I go to a Seven-Eleven and ask for a
	two-by-four and a box of three-by-fives.

	The sign said "eight items or less".  So I changed my name to
	Les.

	Yesterday I saw a chicken crossing the road.  I asked it why.
	It told me it was none of my business.

	I rented a lottery ticket.  I won a million dollars.  But I had

	I took a course in speed reading.  Then I got Reader's Digest on
	microfilm.  By the time I got the machine set up, I was done.

	Yesterday I found out what doughnuts are for.  You put them on

	make erector sets out of play-dough.

	found spirit gum.

	I went to a garage sale.  "How much for the garage?"  "It's not

	I know the guy who writes all those bumper stickers.  He hates
	New York.

	A beautiful woman moved in next door.  So I went over and
	returned a cup of sugar.  "You didn't borrow this."  "I will."

	I had my coathangers spayed.

	I washed a sock.  Then I put it in the dryer.  When I took it
	out, it was gone.

	Alaska.  Now Santa Claus is missing.

	I went to a fancy french restaurant called "Deja Vu."  The
	headwaiter said, "Don't I know you?"

	Last week I forgot how to ride a bicycle.

	I took lessons in bicycle riding.  But I could only afford half
	of them.  Now I can ride a unicycle.

	Use enough to get it up to a good, say, 10 or 12-D.

	I heard that in relativity theory space and time are the same
	thing.  Einstein discovered this when he kept showing up three

	I worked as a lumberjack for a lumber company.  All of the trees
	were just 10 feet high and 1/4 inch thick.  We made paneling.

	Called a blind date to set up a meeting at a restaurant.  I

"Ordinarily he was insane, but he had lucid moments when he was merely stupid"
	Heinrich Heine

*******************************************************************
AMERICA (See Politics)

If you think the United States has stood still, who built the largest
shopping center in the world?

America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without
civilization in between. 
     Oscar Wilde   

Tip the world over on its side and everything loose will land in Los Angeles.

ART/MUSIC

Life beats down and crushes the soul and art reminds you that you have one
     Stella Adler

I see music as the augmentation of a split second of time.
     Erin Cleary

Now, in reality, the world have paid too great a compliment to critics, and 
have imagined them to be men of much greater profundity then they really are.
     Henry Fielding

Poetry begins in delight and ends in wisdom
     Robert Frost

You're an actor, are you?  Well, all that means is:  you are irresponsible,
irrational, romantic, and incapable of handling an adult emotion or a
universal concept without first reducing it to something personal, material,
sensational -- and probably sexual!
     George Herman, _A Company of Wayward Saints_

But that's what being an artist _is_ -- feeling crummy before everyone else
feels crummy.
     The New Yorker

Without music life would be a mistake
     Friedrich Nietzsche

Wagner's music is better than it sounds
     Mark Twain

A critic is a legless man who teaches running. 

Any fool can paint a picture, but it takes a wise person to be able to sell
it. 

Writing free verse is like playing tennis with the net down. 

Disco is to music what Etch-A-Sketch is to art. 

What garlic is to food, insanity is to art.

CHILDREN/YOUTH (See Marriage/Family)

Childhood:  The period of human life intermediate between the idiocy of
infancy and the folly of youth -- two removes from the sin of manhood and
three from the remorse of age. 
     Ambrose Bierce, "The Devil's Dictionary"
 
You are only young once, but you can stay immature indefinitely. 

Do infants have as much fun in infancy as adults do in adultery? 

You can call her an outdoor girl if she has the bloom of youth on her cheeks
and the cheeks of youth in her bloomers. 

Children are natural mimics who act like their parents despite every effort
to teach them good manners. 

Children seldom misquote you.  In fact, they usually repeat word for word
what you shouldn't have said. 

*******************************************************************
COMPUTERS

If the automobile had followed the same development as the computer, a
Rolls-Royce would today cost $100, get a million miles per gallon, and
explode once a year killing everyone inside.      
     Robert Cringely/InfoWorld

To err is human, to compute divine. Trust your computer but not its
programmer
     Morris Kingston  

To err is human--and to blame it on a computer is even more so.
     Orben's Current Comedy

To err is human;  to really foul things up requires a computer. 

Computers aren't intelligent, they only think they are.

The goal of Computer Science is to build somthing that will last at least
until we've finished building it. 
  
Real Programmers think better when playing Adventure or Rogue. 
  
Whenever possible blame the hardware. 

*******************************************************************
DECADENCE

I either want less corruption, or more chance to participate in it.
     Ashleigh Brilliant 
 
Excess on occasion is exhilarating.  It prevents moderation from acquiring
the deadening effect of a habit.

why I'll do it again.

tried before. 
     Mae West 
 
Too much of a good thing is WONDERFUL. 
     Mae West 

I like the word 'indolence'.  It makes my laziness seem classy.
     Bern Williams

The good die young - because they see it's no use living if you've got to be
good. 

Virtue is its own reward, but then so is sin! 

*******************************************************************
DESIRE

When one door closes another door opens; but we so often look so long and so
regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for
us.

Better murder an infant in its cradle than nurse an unacted desire
     William Blake

Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp--or what's a heaven for?
     Robert Browning

Given the choice between the experience of pain and nothing, I would choose

whiskey for three, and enough women for four.

Whatever you want too much, you can't have, so when you REALLY want
something, try to want it a little less.
     Walter Slovotsky, _The Sleeping Dragon_ by Joel Rosenberg

Help me to resist temptation, Lord, especially when I know no one is looking.

If you haven't all the things you want, be grateful for the things you don't
have that you wouldn't want

What is my loftiest ambition?  I've always wanted to throw an egg at an
electric fan. 

*******************************************************************
ECONOMICS/MONEY/BUSINESS

What this country needs is a good five-cent nickel. 
     Frank Adams 
 
If you can count your money, you don't have a billion dollars.
     J. Paul Getty 

I'm proud of paying taxes.  The only thing is --- I could be just as proud
for half the money. 
     Arthur Godfrey 
 
The trick is to stop thinking it is `your' money. 
     IRS auditor 
  
The rich will do anything for the poor but get off their backs. 
     Karl Marx 
 
If Karl, instead of writing a lot about capital, had made a lot of it ... it
would have been much better. 
     Karl Marx's Mother

An executive is a person who always decides; sometimes he decides correctly,
but he always decides.
     John H. Patterson

When better business decisions are made, economists won't make them. 
     H. V. Prochnow 
 
I'd give $1000 to be a millionaire. 
     Lewis Timberlake 

I am opposed to millionaires, but it would be dangerous to offer me the
position.
     Mark Twain

Economists are people who work with numbers but don't have the personality
to be accountants. 
 
A budget is just a method of worrying before you spend money, as well as
afterward. 

Money will say more in one moment than the most eloquent lover can in years. 

If all economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion. 

*******************************************************************
EDUCATION

Learning is finding out what you already know
     Richard Bach

Genius without education is like silver in the mine. 
     Ben Franklin 
 
God made the Idiot for practice, and then He made the School Board 
     Mark Twain 

About all some parents accomplish in life is to send a child to Harvard. 

A professor is one who talks in someone else's sleep. 

I have never let my schooling interfere with my educations. 

*******************************************************************
EGO

Nobody can be exactly like me. Even I have trouble doing it. 
     Tallulah Bankhead 

An egotist is a person of low taste--more interested in himself than in me.
     Ambrose Bierce

Big egos are big shields for lots of empty space
     Diana Black

I may not be totally perfect, but parts of me are excellent.
     Ashleigh Brilliant 

A really busy person never knows how much he weighs.

I never loved another person the way I loved myself. 
     Mae West 

Swallowing pride never choked anyone

The best thing to do behind a person's back is to pat it

When science finally locates the center of the universe, some people will be
surprised to learn they're not it.

*******************************************************************
FOOLS

There's no fool like an old fool --- you can't beat experience. 
     Jacob Braude 
 
Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain - and most fools do.
     Dale Carnegie

There is no cause so right that one cannot find a fool following it.
     Niven's Law # 16 

It is impossible to make anything foolproof because fools are so ingenius.

Every absurdity has a champion to defend it. 

Let a fool hold his tongue and he will pass for a sage. 

To laugh at men of sense is the privilege of fools. 

*******************************************************************
FRIENDS/ENEMIES

Friendships are fragile things, and require as much handling as any other
fragile and precious thing.
     Randolph S. Bourne

A man cannot be too careful in his choice of enemies.
     Oscar Wilde

We really don't have enemies.  It's just that some of our best friends are
trying to kill us.

Advice from your friends in like the weather, some of it is good, some of it
is bad.

Never speak ill of yourself;  your friends will always say enough on that
subject. 

With clothes the new are best, with friends the old are best. 

*******************************************************************
HAPPINESS

Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without
action.
     Benjamin Disraeli

Happiness is just an illusion caused by the temporary absence of reality.

Happiness:  An agreeable sensation arising from contemplating the misery of
another. 

*******************************************************************
HISTORY/PAST

If you had your life to live over again--you'd need more money.
     Construction Digest

What we anticipate seldom occurs; what we least expected generally happens.
     Benjamin Disraeli

Things are more like they are now than they ever were before. 
     Dwight D. Eisenhower 

In times like these, it helps to recall that there have always been times
like these.
     Paul Harvey

If history repeats itself, and the unexpected always happens, how incapable
must Man be of learning from experience
     George Bernard Shaw

We learn from history that we do not learn anything from history.

HUMOR

Hanging is too good for a man who makes puns; he should be drawn and quoted.
     Fred Allen

Laughter is the closest distance between two people.
     Victor Borge

Tragedy is when I cut my finger.  Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer
and die.
     Mel Brooks

If a man insisted always on being serious, and never allowed himself a bit
of fun and relaxation, he would go mad or become unstable without knowing it.
     Herodotus

The muse of humor has once again looked down upon me, and found me worthy to
carry out the deeds of her noble cause.
     Michael S. Rosenberg

He who laughs, lasts. 

If you think before you speak the other guy gets its joke in first.  A person
will sometimes devote all his life to the development of one part of his body
- the wishbone. 

Blessed are they who can laugh at themselves, for they shall never cease to
be amused.

The only way to amuse some people is to slip and fall on an icy pavement. 

*******************************************************************
KNOWLEDGE/WISDOM (see Mind)

Real knowledge is to know the extent of ones ignorance. 
     Confucius 
 
It takes a long time to understand nothing. 
     Edward Dahlberg 
 
A wise man sees as much as he ought, not as much as he can.
     Montaigne

We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in
it--and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove
lid.  She will never sit on a hot stove lid again--and that is well; but also
she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.
     Mark Twain

Your ignorance cramps my conversation. 

Half the world is composed of people who have something to say and can't, and
the other half who have nothing to say and keep on saying it. 

The confidence of ignorance will always overcome indecision of knowledge. 

Philosophy: unintelligible answers to insoluble problems. 

Those who talk don't know.  Those who don't talk, know. 

Dawn:  The time when men of reason go to bed.  Certain old men prefer to rise
at about that time, taking a cold bath and a long walk with an empty stomach,
and otherwise mortifying the flesh. They then point with pride to these
practices as the cause of their sturdy health and ripe years; the truth being
that they are hearty and old, not because of their habits, but in spite of
them.  The reason we find only robust persons doing this thing is that it has
killed all the others who have tried it. 

It is a truly wise man who does not play leap frog with a unicorn. 

The decision doesn't have to be logical, it was unanimous. 

*******************************************************************
LANGUAGE

Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect?  There's a frood who really knows
where his towel is.
     Douglas Adams, _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_

Language is a virus from outer space.
     William S. Burroughs

We are getting into semantics again.  If we use words, there is a very grave
danger they will be misinterpreted.
     H. R. Haldeman, testifying in his own defense. 

Conversation is the slowest form of human communication. 

Drawing on my fine command of language, I said nothing. 

It took me fifteen  years to discover I had no talent for writing, 
but I couldn't give it up because by that time I was too famous. 

*******************************************************************
LEGEND/VALOR

Legend --- a lie that has attained the dignity of age. 
     H. L. Mencken 
 
I find that we all get more legendary as time goes by.  "Legend" means,
basically, "bullshit."
     Walter Slovotsky, _The Warrior Lives_ by Joel Rosenberg

Slovotsky's Law Number Thirty-One:  Get scared right away; avoid the rush.
     Walter Slovotsky, _The Warrior Lives_ by Joel Rosenberg

...the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is
before them, glory and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding go out to meet
it.
     Thucydides

Heroes have an infinite capacity for stupidity.  Thus are legends born! 

They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Naturally they became
heroes. 

*******************************************************************
LIFE/DEATH

I do not believe in an afterlife, although I am bringing a change of

ordeal of meeting me is another matter. 
     Winston Churchill 
  
...the fog is rising
     Emily Dickinson's last words

Millions long for immortality who do not know what to do with themselves on
a rainy Sunday afternoon. 
     Susan Ertz 

If people concentrated on the really important things in life, there'd be a
shortage of fishing pole.
     Doug Larson

If I knew I was going to live this long, I'd have taken better care of
myself. 
     Mickey Mantle 

In spite of the cost of living, it's still popular. 
     Kathy Norris 
 
Am I lightheaded because I'm not dead or because I'm still alive?
     Heidi Sandige

When the Black Camel comes for me, I'm not going to go kicking and screaming-
-I am, however, going to try to talk my way out of it.  "No, no, you want the
other Walter Slovotsky."
     Walter Slovotsky, _The Warrior Lives_ by Joel Rosenberg

We who are about to die, are going to take one hell of a lot of the bastards
with us.
     Karl Cullinane, _The Silver Crown_ by Joel Rosenberg

If you can spend a perfectly useless afternoon in a perfectly useless manner,
you have learned how to live.
     Lin Yutang

May you live all the days of your life. 

What is life, except excuse for death, or death but an escape from life. 

Life is a whim of several billion cells to be you for a while. 

Live every day as if it were your last and then some day you'll be right. 
 
Like most endeavors, life is seriously over-advertised and under-funded

Death:  to stop sinning suddenly. 

All of the animals except man know that the principal business of 
life is to enjoy it.

There are more dead people than living.  And their numbers are 
increasing.  The living are getting rarer. 

*******************************************************************
LOVE (See Sex)

Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love. 
     Charlie Brown 

Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of
his personality
     Victor Frankel

Love is a hole in the heart.
     Ben Hecht

She's a very dominant woman; she walks on the ground I worship
     Dennis Miller

Many a young lady does not realize just how strong her love for a young man
is until he fails to pass the approval test with her parents. 

There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear. 

Of all forms of caution, caution in love is the most fatal. 

*******************************************************************
MARRIAGE/FAMILY (See Children/Youth)

A psychiatrist asks a lot of expensive questions your wife asks for nothing. 
     Joey Adams 
 
I swear, if you existed I'd divorce you.
     Edward Albee

Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another
city. 
     George Burns 
 
Breast Feeding should not be attempted by fathers with hairy chests, since
they can make the baby sneeze and give it wind.
     Mike Harding, "The Armchair Anarchist's Almanac" 

Marriage is a lottery, but you can't tear up your ticket if you lose. 
     F. M. Knowles 
 
When we are planning for posterity, we ought to remember that virtue is not
hereditary.
     Thomas Paine

Familiarity breeds contempt --- and children. 
     Mark Twain 

By the time a man realizes that maybe his father was right, he usually has
a son who thinks he's wrong.
     Charles Wadsworth

Never try to guess your wife's size.  Just buy her anything marked `petite'
and hold on to the receipt. 
 
There may be some doubt as to who are the best people to have children, but
there can be no doubt that parents are the worst. 

Marriage is like the army.  Everybody complains, but you'd be surprised at
how many re-enlist.

Do you think your mother and I should have lived comfortably so long together
if ever we had been married? 

There is one thing more exasperating than a spouse who can cook and won't,
and that's a spouse who can't cook and will. 

In marriage, as in war, it is permitted to take every advantage of the enemy.

My notion of a wife at forty is that a man should be able to change her, like
a bank note, for two twenties. 

*******************************************************************
MIND (see Knowledge/wisdom)

-Well, here's something to occupy you and keep your mind off things.

     Ambrose Bierce, "The Devil's Dictionary"

"Contrariwise", continued Tweedledee, "If it was so, it might be; and if it

     Lewis Carroll 
 
It is no longer my moral duty as a human being to achieve an integrated and
unitary set of explanations for my thoughts and feelings.
     Bronwyn Davies

Minds are like parachutes - they only function when open.
     Thomas Dewar

Just on the border of your waking mind, there lies another time, where
darkness and light are one. And as you tread the halls of sanity, you feel
so glad to be unable to go beyond. I have a message from another time.....
     ELO: "Prologue from the "Time" album -- Daicon IV Opening Animation

A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.
     Ralph Waldo Emerson

George was a great dunce, but no matter for that:  all men do not thrive in

It's great to be young and insane.
     Michael Keaton, "Dream Team"

The intelligent man is one who has successfully fulfilled many
accomplishments, and is yet willing to learn more.
     Ed Parker 

Few people think more than two or three times a year; I have made an
international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week.
     George Bernard Shaw 

It is dangerous to be sincere unless you are also stupid.
     George Bernard Shaw

The melancholy truth was that his glorious golden head had nothing in it.
     Cecil Woodham Smith

The brain is a wonderful organ; it starts working the moment you get up in
the morning, and does not stop until you get into the office. 

Some minds are like concrete - all mixed up and permanently set.

If ignorance is bliss, why aren't there more happy people? 

He was so narrow-minded he could see through a keyhole with two eyes. 

Never underestimate the power of human stupidity. 

Designed with your mind in mind by people who have in mind what you should
have in mind. 

There is no expedient to which a man will not go to avoid 
the real labor of thinking. 

If we increase the size of the penguin until it is the same height as a man
and then compare the relative brain size, we know find that the penguin's
brain is still smaller. But, and this is the point, it is larger than it WAS!

Genius is the talent of a person who is dead. 

When a stupid person is doing something it is ashamed of, it always declares
that it is his job.

It is hereditary, but fortunately not contagious.

Gyroscope, n.: 
     A wheel or disk mounted to spin rapidly about an axis and also free to
rotate about one or both of two axes perpendicular to each other and the axis

the angular momentum to any torque that would change the direction of the

Bobby Knight told me this: "There is nothing that a good defense
cannot beat a better offense."  In other words a good offense wins.
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle, in a speech to the City Club
                   of Chicago, comparing the offensive capabilities of the

Right now we have a theory of mutually assured destruction that supposedly
provides for peace and stability, and it's worked.  But that doesn't mean
that we can't build upon a concept of MAD where both sides are vulnerable
to another attack.  Why wouldn't an enhanced deterrent, a more stable
peace, a better prospect to denying the ones who enter conflict in the
first place to have a reduction of offensive systems and an introduction
to defensive capability.  I believe that is the route this country will
eventually go.

Mars is essentially in the same orbit... Mars is somewhat the same distance
from the Sun, which is very important. We have seen pictures where there are
canals, we believe, and water. If there is water, that means there is oxygen.
If oxygen, that means we can breathe.

                   (reported in Esquire, 8/92)

Hawaii has always been a very pivotal role in the Pacific.  It is IN

                   (reported in Esquire, 8/92)

Hawaii is a unique state. It is a small state. It is a state that is by
itself. It is a -- it is different than the other 49 states. Well, all states
are different, but it's got a particularly unique situation.

You all look like happy campers to me.  Happy campers you are, happy
campers you have been, and, as far as I am concerned, happy campers you
will always be.

                   (reported in The Chicago Tribune, 2/4/89)

El Salvador is a democracy so it's not surprising that there are many voices
to be heard here. Yet in my conversations with Salvadorans... I have heard a
single voice.
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle

I believe we are on an irreversible trend toward more freedom and
democracy - but that could change.

                   (reported in Esquire, 8/92)

One learns every day.  Experience is a great teacher.  By experience you
learn.  But as I enter office, I'm prepared now.  Obviously, I will be
more prepared as time goes on.  I will know more about the office of the
presidency.  But I'm prepared now and I will be more prepared as time goes
on.

Target prices?  How that works?  I know quite a bit about farm policy.
I come from Indiana, which is a farm state.  Deficiency payments -
which are the key - that is what gets money into the farmer's hands.
We got loan, uh, rates, we got target, uh, prices, uh, I have worked
very closely with my senior colleague, (Indiana Sen.) Richard Lugar,
making sure that the farmers of Indiana are taken care of.

                   conference, after two minutes and 30 seconds.

I'm not going to focus on what I have done in the past what I stand for,

I guess you'll have to ask the details to the management, I am here.

Certainly, I know what to do, and when I am Vice President -- and
I will be -- there will be contingency plans under different sets of
situations. And I tell you what, I'm not going to go out and hold a news
conference about it. I'm going to put it in a safe and keep it there! Does
that answer your question?

                   (reported in the Washington Post, 8/26/88)

                   service during the Vietnam war.

        Don't forget about the importance of the family. It begins with
the family. We're not going to redefine the family. Everybody knows the
definition of the family. [Meaningful pause] A child. [Meaningful pause] A
mother. [Meaningful pause] A father. There are other arrangements of the
family, but that is a family and family values.
        I've been very blessed with wonderful parents and a wonderful
family, and I am proud of my family. Anybody turns to their family. I have
a very good family. I'm very fortunate to have a very good family. I
believe very strongly in the family. It's one of the things we have in
our platform, is to talk about it.
                -- Senator Dan Quayle, 8/27/88
                   (reported in Esquire, 8/92)

        I suppose three important things certainly come to my mind that we
want to say thank you. The first would be our family. Your family, my
family -- which is composed of an immediate family of a wife and three
children, a larger family with grandparents and aunts and uncles. We all
have our family, whichever that may be ... The very beginnings of
civilization, the very beginnings of this country, goes back to the family.
And time and time again, I'm often reminded, especially in this
Presidential campaign, of the importance of a family, and what a family
means to this country. And so when you pay thanks I suppose the first thing
that would come to mind would be to thank the Lord for the family.
                -- Senator Dan Quayle on the upcoming Thanksgiving

Okay, I won't open it until then
                -- Vice President Dan Quayle after having been
                   presented with an empty box that was to contain
                   a gift from a sailing team in South America.
                   He was told that the gift was not ready yet,
                   but that it would be presented to him when they
                   arrived in the United States.

You always learn something by reading the classics.  Particularly The
Prince.  I go through and look at this from this intellectual point of
view.  Machiavelli had these three classes of mind.  The first class was
the person that was creative enough to be leader and be able to lead a
great nation without much help.  The second class of mind was one that
wasn't creative but could take ideas, put people around him, and be able
to lead nations forward.  And the third class of people didn't really know
much of anything.  And they were the worst kind of leaders, because not
only were they not creative, but they didn't know what was right or wrong,
and they just sort of went by whatever they felt like.
I've tried to figure out where I am.  I know I'm not the first because I don't
think I have the creativeness that Machiavelli talks about.  If I go back and
reread it I might figure it out exactly where I put myself.  I'm somewhere
between two and one.
                -- Senator Dan Quayle gives his opinion of the book
                   "The Prince," 9/28/88 (reported in Esquire, 8/92)

And it was a very good book of Rasputin's involvement in that, which shows

George Bush.

Kevin, what do we do on the pain and suffering on our malpractice proposal?
[He listened briefly to Moley's explanation]
So, it doesn't address it specifically.
The state -- the states could in fact -- what we basically do is --
try to do -- is get the states to come up with medical malpractice
legislation. We have, I think it's five criteria in our suggested
recommendations. But once they meet the five criteria, then they get a
favorable distribution from us if they meet -- basically forcing the states
to adopt this medical malpractice legislation, and that's the way
that you do it.

Space is the next frontier to be explored. And we're going to explore.
Think of all the things we rely upon in space today: communications
from... Japan, detection of potential ballistic missile attacks. Ballistic
missiles are still here. Other nations do have ballistic missiles. How do
you think we were able to detect some of the Scud missiles and things like
that?  Space, reconnaissance, weather, communications - you name it. We

It doesn't help matters when prime time TV has Murphy Brown -- a
character who supposedly epitomizes today's intelligent, highly paid,
professional woman -- mocking the importance of fathers, by bearing a
child alone, and calling it just another "lifestyle choice."
I know it is not fashionable to talk about moral values, but we need to
do it. Even though our cultural leaders in Hollywood, network TV, the
national newspapers routinely jeer at them, I think that most of us in

When I have been asked during these last weeks who caused the riots and

My position is that I understand from a medical situation, immediately
after a rape is reported, that a woman normally, in fact, can go to the

   If you elect Bill Clinton and Al Gore that would be a disaster for
agriculture.  What Bill Clinton says he'll do, well, I'll tell you what
I'm going to do is to give a lot of balance to the interest here in California.
What we would have is an environmental summit, and guess who's going to be the
head of that enironmental summit? It's not going to be the Governor of
Arkansas. He's going to put Senator Al Gore in charge of the environmental
summit and his book will be the agenda for that environmental summit.
  I hope everyone reads that book.  We wanted to take that book to our debate,
but for some reason Al Gore didn't want us to have the book in the debate
because we wanted to make sure everyone knew what was in that book.  Because
that's the agenda for Bill Clinton.  That's the agenda of the Clinton-Gore
administration. Here's what he says about farmers.  Here's what he says
about agriculture in that book.  He says that farmers strip-mine the land.
He says that agriculture is in fact bulldozing the Garden of Eden.  Well I
tell you what, if you elect Bill Clinton and Al Gore you can say goodbye to
water, goodbye to food, and goodbye to your jobs. But come November the 3'rd,
the American people are going to say good-bye to Bill Clinton and Al Gore.

[David Broder: Doesn't that sound like a case where the public is
getting shafted and there may be a need for local regulation or F.C.C.
regulation?]
Yeah. There is F.C.C. regulation. There is regulation.

That's true, but there is ----
[Well, tell me in simple terms that people can understand: Why shouldn't
they be regulated?]
O.K., simple terms, here's the choice. Here's the choice in simple

regulation or through genuine competition? Our preference is to do it
through genuine competition.

                  with David Frost, 10/92.

It was a good campaign contribution to Bill Clinton, but he gets a lot of

                   corrected Quayle when the story was over.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dan Quayle had a trip planned to Beijing, but was worried because of
the turmoil at that end. His security advisor however informed him that
it was pretty safe for D.Q. as, "They are only harassing intellectuals."

Republican activist Dana Reed said he was amused recently when he received
an unsolicited certificate of commendation signed by Vice President
Dan Quayle.  The honor was awarded to Reed as "a champion of the traditional
American values of family, faith, hard work and morality."  Reed quipped,
"I'm twice-divorced and "Murphy Brown" is my favorite TV show"
(reported July, 92 by the Orange County Register)

On 10/11/88 Dan Quayle held a pumpkin next to his head.
(reported in Esquire 8/92)

On 6/13/89, Dan Quayle posed in El Salvador holding a grenade launcher.
Unbeknownst to him, it was aimed at his elbow.
(reported in Esquire 8/92)

Quayle was very enthusiastic about signing author Tom Clancy to the National
Space Council as an unpaid consultant (see his quote re: Red Storm Rising).
Clancy, however, was not Quayle's first choice; that honor went to famed
aviator Clutch Cargo.  A plan to approach him and offer him the position was
scuttled when it was discovered that Mr. Cargo is a fictional character.
(reported in The New Republic, 7/3/89)

During the White House Easter Egg Roll of 1991, Quayle signed autographs
using only his finger. He had prepared pre-signed cards which his aides
handed out while he made signing gestures. This allowed him to move briskly
and efficiently through the crowd, said his spokesman.

Dan Quayle, in April 1991, was concerned that his advisors
may be getting out of touch with "Real Americans." In order
to combat this, he suggested that they read People magazine.

On 8/13/91 lawyer Dan Quayle tells the American Bar Association that the
US has too many lawyers.  He is quickly scolded by another speaker.
(reported in Esquire 8/92)

While discussing the terms of the vice-presidential debate, Quayle's aide
suggested that "props" be allowed, mainly because the Vice-President
wanted to read directly from Al Gore's book on the environment,
"Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit." Gore's people agreed,
saying that the Senator would then use a potato as a prop. Quayle quickly
abandoned the proposal.  (reported in The NY Times, 10/6/92)

"I loved you. And love for you has not yet burned out of my soul. But  
don't let my love cause you distress any more. I don't wish to bring you  
grief. I loved you silently, hopelessly, sometimes in joy, sometimes in  
jealousy. I loved you so sincerely, so tenderly. Ah, may God grant that  
you be so loved by another."

The following ties in nicely with another thread (What is music?)
All I know about music is that not many people ever really hear it.  And even t
hen, on the rare occasions that something opens within, and the music enters, w
hat we mainly hear, or hear corraborated, are personal, private, vanishing evoc
ations.  But the man who creates the music is hearing somethin else, is dealing
 with the roar rising from the void, and imposing order on it as it hits the ai
r.  What is evoked in him, then, is of another order, more terrible because it
has no wards, and more triumphant, too, for that same reason.  And his triumph,
 when he triumphs, is ours.  -- James Baldwin "Sonny's Blues"

 seek Gad!" -- As there were many people standing about who did not believe in
God, he caused a great deal of amusement.  Why! is he lost? said one.  Has he
strayed away like a child?  said another.  Or does he keep himself hidden?  Is
he afraid of us?  Has he taken a sea-voyage?  has he emigrated? -- the people c
ried out laughingly, all in a hubub.  The insane man jumped into their midst an

	"Our rights remain rights only as long as we have the
prudence not to test them"  -Mark Twain

   "Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired
signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not
fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.  This world in arms is not
spending money alone.  It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the
genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.  This is not a way
of life at all in any true sense.  Under the clouds of war, it is
humanity hanging on a cross of iron."

of the passionate intellect that has tied them together, or 
tried.  That's why programming-- or buying software-- on the

Slovotsky's Law Number Thirty-One:  Get scared right away; avoid the rush.
     Walter Slovotsky, "The Warrior Lives" by Joel Rosenberg

fittest keeps putting himself in situations where he is most likely to be
creamed?
     Solomon Short

...the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is

Things are more like they are now than they ever were before. 
     Dwight D. Eisenhower 

In times like these, it helps to recall that there have always been times
like these.
     Paul Harvey

Hardly a pure science, history is closer to animal husbandry than it is to
mathematics, in that it involves selective breeding.  The principal
difference between the husbandryman and the historian is that the former
breeds sheep or cows or such, and the latter breeds (assumed) facts.  The
husbandryman uses his skills to enrich the future; the historian uses his to
enrich the past.  Both are usually up to their ankles in bullshit.
     Tom Robbins

Any event, once it has occurered, can be made to appear inevitable by a
competent historian.
     Lee Simonson

If history repeats itself, and the unexpected always happens, how incapable
must Man be of learning from experience
     George Bernard Shaw

When I was younger, I could remember anything, whether it had happened or
not; but my faculties are decaying now and soon I shall be so I cannot
remember any but the things that never happened.  It is sad to go to pieces
like this but we all have to do it.
     Mark Twain

Indeed, history is nothing more than a tableau of crimes and misfortunes.
     Voltaire

History is made at night.  Character is what you are in the dark.
     Lord John Whorfin

We learn from history that we do not learn anything from history. 

Living in the past has one thing in its favor - it's cheaper.

Tragedy is when I cut my finger.  Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer

We must laugh before we are happy, for fear we die before we laugh at all.

A joke is a very serious thing.
     Winston Churchill

Humor is a universal language.
     Joel Goodman

There are things that are so serious that you can only joke about them.
     Heisenberg

If a man insisted always on being serious, and never allowed himself a bit
of fun and relaxation, he would go mad or become unstable without knowing it.
     Herodotus

A satirist is a man who discovers unpleasant things about himself and then
says them about other people.
     Peter McArthur

Humor is our greatest natural resource.
     James Thurber

Seven days without laughter makes one weak.
     Mort Walker

If you think before you speak the other guy gets its joke in first.  

A person will sometimes devote all his life to the development of one part
of his body - the wishbone. 

Blessed are they who can laugh at themselves, for they shall never cease to

KNOWLEDGE/WISDOM (see Mind/Intelligence)

I find that a great part of the information I have was acquired by looking
up something and finding something else on the way.
     Franklin P. Adams

Even a fool knows you can't touch the stars, but it doesn't stop a wise man
from trying.
     Harry Anderson, "Night Court"

The first step towards knowledge is to know that we are ignorant.
     Richard Cecil

Real knowledge is to know the extent of ones ignorance. 
     Confucius 
 
It takes a long time to understand nothing. 
     Edward Dahlberg 
 
Imagination is more important than knowledge.
     Albert Einstein

The little I know I owe to my ignorance.
     Sacha Guitry

The beginning of knowledge is the discovery of something we do not
understand.
     Frank Herbert

Ignorance is a voluntary misfortune
     Nicholas Ling

A child of five would understand this.  Send someone to fetch a child of
five.
     Groucho Marx

It is impossible to defeat an ignorant man in argument.
     William G. McAdoo

A wise man sees as much as he ought, not as much as he can.
     Montaigne

We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in
it -- and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove
lid.  She will never sit on a hot stove lid again -- and that is well; but
also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.
     Mark Twain

Knowledge is soon changed, then lost in the mist, an echo half-heard.
     Gene Wolfe

Your ignorance cramps my conversation. 

If ignorance is bliss, why aren't there more happy people? 

The confidence of ignorance will always overcome indecision of knowledge. 

Dawn:  The time when men of reason go to bed.  Certain old men prefer to rise
at about that time, taking a cold bath and a long walk with an empty stomach,
and otherwise mortifying the flesh. They then point with pride to these
practices as the cause of their sturdy health and ripe years; the truth being
that they are hearty and old, not because of their habits, but in spite of
them.  The reason we find only robust persons doing this thing is that it has
killed all the others who have tried it.

LANGUAGE

Language is a virus from outer space.
     William S. Burroughs

>From now on, ending a sentence with a preposition is something up with which

     Winston Churchill 

Even if you do learn to speak correct English, whom are you going to speak
it to?

     Felelon

If the King's English was good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for me!
     "Ma" Ferguson, Governor of Texas 

We are getting into semantics again.  If we use words, there is a very grave
danger they will be misinterpreted.
     H. R. Haldeman, testifying in his own defense. 

Words are, of course, the most powerful drug used by mankind.
     Rudyard Kipling

The English have no respect for their language, and will not teach their

How often misused words generate misleading thoughts.
     Herbert Spencer

Man invented language to satisfy his deep need to complain.
     Lily Tomlin

A witty saying proves nothing
     Voltaire

We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language.  Language is
not simply a reporting device for experience but a defining framework for it.
     Benjamin Whorf

Conversation is the slowest form of human communication. 

Drawing on my fine command of language, I said nothing.

Friends applaud, the Comedy is over.
     Ludwig von Beethoven

Goodbye, Everybody!
     Hart Crane, poet, who committed suicide by jumping overboard during a

the grass and loses itself in the sunset.
     Crowfoot, Blackfoot warior and orator, 1890
 
...the fog is rising

     Bugs Bunny 
 
Too many people are thinking of security instead of opportunity.  They seem

LOGIC/REASON

Logic:  The art of thinking and reasoning in strict accordance with
the limitations and incapacities of the human misunderstanding.  
     Ambrose Bierce, "The Devil's Dictionary"

Fantasy, abandoned by reason, produces impossible monsters; united with it,
she is the mother of the arts and the origin of marvels.
     Goya

Only a brave person is willing to honestly admit, and fearlessly to face,
what a sincere and logical mind discovers.
     Rodan of Alexandria

The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable man persists
in trying to adapt the world to himself.  Therefore all progress depends on
the unreasonable man.

LOVE (See Sex)

To love is to suffer.  To avoid suffering one must not love.  But then one
suffers from not loving.  Therefore, to love is to suffer; not to love is to
suffer; to suffer is to suffer.  To be happy is to love.  To be happy, then,
is to suffer, but suffering makes one unhappy.  Therefore, to be happy one
must love or love to suffer or suffer from too much happiness.
     Woody Allen

Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but
among those whom I love, I can:  all of them make me laugh.
     W. H. Auden

Absence is to love what wind is to fire; it extinguishes the small, it
enkindles the great.

Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love.

There are very few people who are not ashamed of having been in love when
they no longer love each other.

Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of
his personality
     Victor Frankel

Love is an irresistable desire to be irresistably desired.

A man in love is incomplete until he is married.  Then he's finished.
     Zsa Zsa Gabor

Love is a hole in the heart.

Love is like pi -- natural, irrational, and VERY important.

Love is only the dirty trick played on us to achieve continuation of the
species.
     W. Somerset Maugham, "A Writer's Notebook" 1949

Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence.
     H. L. Mencken

Love is but the discovery of ourselves in others, and the delight in the
recognition.
     Alexander Smith

Many a young lady does not realize just how strong her love for a young man
is until he fails to pass the approval test with her parents. 

There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear. 

Of all forms of caution, caution in love is the most fatal.

MARRIAGE/FAMILY (See Children/Youth)

A psychiatrist asks a lot of expensive questions your wife asks for nothing.

Marriage is give and take.  You'd better give it to her or she'll take it
anyway.
     Joey Adams

I swear, if you existed I'd divorce you.
     Edward Albee

It is easier to be a lover than a husband for the simple reason that it is
more difficult to be witty every day than to say pretty things from time to
time.
     Honor de Balzac, "The Physiology of Marriage" 1829

Marriage must incessantly contend with a monster that devours everything: 
familiarity.
     Honor de Balzac, "The Physiology of Marriage" 1829

Marriage is the result of the longing for the deep, deep peace of the double
bed after the hurly-burly of the chaise longue.
     Mrs. Patrick Campbell

My wife and I tried to breakfast together, but we ahd to stop or our marriage
would have been wrecked.
     Winston Churchill

Breast Feeding should not be attempted by fathers with hairy chests, since
they can make the baby sneeze and give it wind.
     Mike Harding, "The Armchair Anarchist's Almanac" 

Marriage is a lottery, but you can't tear up your ticket if you lose. 
     F. M. Knowles 

There's a way of transferring funds that is even faster than electronic

     James Holt McGavran
 
Bachelors know more about women than married men; if they didn't they'd be

     H. L. Mencken

Marriage is like a cage; one sees the birds outside desperate to get in, and
those inside equally desperate to get out.
     Michel de Montaigne

When we are planning for posterity, we ought to remember that virtue is not

     Thomas Paine

Familiarity breeds contempt -- and children. 
     Mark Twain 

By the time a man realizes that maybe his father was right, he usually has
a son who thinks he's wrong.
     Charles Wadsworth

Never try to guess your wife's size.  Just buy her anything marked `petite'
and hold on to the receipt. 
 
There may be some doubt as to who are the best people to have children, but
there can be no doubt that parents are the worst. 

Marriage is like the army.  Everybody complains, but you'd be surprised at
how many re-enlist.

Do you think your mother and I should have lived comfortably so long together
if ever we had been married? 

There is one thing more exasperating than a spouse who can cook and won't,
and that's a spouse who can't cook and will. 

In marriage, as in war, it is permitted to take every advantage of the enemy.

My notion of a wife at forty is that a man should be able to change her, like
a bank note, for two twenties.

Mathematicians are like Frenchmen:  whatever you say to them they translate

     Goethe
 
Mathematics, rightly viewed, posses not only truth, but supreme beauty -- a
beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture.

Perhaps the purpose of categorical algebra is to show that which is trivial,

The function of genius is not to give new answers, but to pose new questions

The mind has exactly the same power as the hands:  not merely to grasp the
world, but to change it.
     Colin Wilson

I not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can borrow.
     Woodrow Wilson

The right half of the brain controls the left half of the body.  This means
that only left handed people are in their right mind.

The only difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its
limits.

Stupidity, like virtue, is its own reward.

The brain is a wonderful organ; it starts working the moment you get up in
the morning, and does not stop until you get into the office. 

Never underestimate the power of human stupidity. 

There is no expedient to which a man will not go to avoid the real labor of
thinking. 

If we increase the size of the penguin until it is the same height as a man
and then compare the relative brain size, we know find that the penguin's
brain is still smaller. But, and this is the point, it is larger than it WAS!

Genius is the talent of a person who is dead. 

When a stupid person is doing something it is ashamed of, it always declares
that it is his job.

When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything
else in the universe.
     John Muir (1838-1914)

For after all what is man in nature?  A nothing in relation to infinity, all
in relation to nothing, a central point between nothing and all and
infinitely far from understanding either.  The ends of things and their
beginnings are impregnably concealed from him in an impenetrable secret.  He
is equally incapable of seeing the nothingness out of which he was drawn and
the infinite in which he is engulfed.
     Blaise Pascal

The effort to understand the universe is one of the very few things that
lifts human life a little above the level of farce, and gives it some of the
grace of tragedy.
     Steven Weinberg

Reality is good for you...in small doses. 

The universe is laughing behind your back.

WRITING

The only thing I was fit for was to be a writer, and this notion rested
solely on my suspicion that I would never be fit for real work, and that
writing didn't require any.
     Russell Baker

The reserve of modern assertions is sometimes pushed to extremes, in which
the fear of being contradicted leads the writer to strip himself of almost
all sense and meaning.
     Winston S. Churchill

Asking a working writer what he thinks about critics is like asking a
lamppost how it feels about dogs.
     Christopher Hampton

It took me fifteen years to discover I had no talent for writing, 
but I couldn't give it up because by that time I was too famous. 

Writing free verse is like playing tennis with the net down.

exceptionality was the greatest and most heroic of values; that those
who were unlike the crowd were to be treasured the most lovingly; and
that this exceptionality was a treasure so great that it had to be
concealed, in ordinary life, beneath what the comic books called a
'secret identity'." -- Salman Rushdie

I too collect the odd quote or two (which is why I read alt.quotations) and
have the odd one or two. I would be happy to share my quotes with you if
you would share yours with me.

Here is an index of what I've got at the moment... you may already have some
of these.

As you can see, there are quite a few (17925 to be more precise) and as you
might guess take up a little disk space (3655K for fortunes, 282K for indexes).

It would be nice if you would be able to forward any other collections that
people are willing to send to you. I currently use a '%%' separated fortune
file format, with 2 indexes for each file, one which lists each fortune's
location, size in bytes/lines and other which indicates how many fortunes
are <= a particular number of lines. This allows uniform random lookups on
the entire database.

                        SUCCESS

To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and
the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics
and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to
find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a
healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; to know
even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.  This is to
have succeeded.

"When I consider the caliber, the bravery and the patriotism of the fine
 young soldiers whose deaths I have witnessed...it is untenable and

 position of commander in chief of our armed forces."

---------------+-------------------------------------------------
>From 'The Little, Brown Book Of Anecdotes' by Clifton Fadiman
 
Albert Einstein was a late talker as a child. His parents were
understandably worried. finally at the supper table one evening, 
He broke his silence to say, "The soup is too hot." Greatly relieved,
his parents asked why he never said a word before. Young Albert
replied, "Because up to now everything was in order." 
---------------+-------------------------------------------------
It is alledged that when Einstein and his wife visited the Mount
Wilson Observatory in California, Mrs. Einstein pointed to a particularly
complex piece of equipment and asked its purpose. Their guide said
that it was used to determine the shape of the universe. "Oh," she
said, not at all impressed, "my husband uses the back of an old 
envelope to work that out."
---------------+-------------------------------------------------

conversation, n. A fair for the display of the minor mental commodities,
each exhibitor being too intent upon the arrangement of his own wares
to observe those of his neighbor.

---------------+-------------------------------------------------
"War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest thing: The decayed and
 degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks nothing
 worth a war is worse. A man who has nothing for which he is
 willing to fight, nothing he cares about more than his personal
 safety, is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free,
 unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than
 himself." -- John Stuart Mill
---------------+-------------------------------------------------
"The price of liberty is, always has been, and always will be blood:
 the person who is not willing to die for his liberty has already lost
 it to the first scoundrel who is willing to risk dying to violate that
 person's liberty. Are you free?" -- Andrew Ford
