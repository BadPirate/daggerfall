King Welmar~
The wise King Welmar sits here in his throne.

In his later middle-age, with his beard starting to grey, King Welmar

almost feline grace.  He actually radiates strength and confidence,
and you have to fight a sudden urge to come to attention as you see
him.

You remember a time almost a decade ago, when the news of the day
was how this man had slaughtered the entire population of the little
village of Townsbridge.  He was imprisoned, and here he is - a shadow
of the undoubtedly great warrior he once was, but still to be reckoned
with.
