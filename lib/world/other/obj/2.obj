mushroom patch~
When you lean down to get a closer look, a small green toad pops out
onto one of the mushrooms and proclaims, 'So, you thought these were
mushrooms...well as you can plainly see it is a TOADSTOOL!'  He then
goes on to stick his tongue out at you and wave it about.  You find
yourself apologizing to a frog!  He looks you squarely in the eye and
tells you, 'You have to be careful who you talk to these days, just
a while ago i  ran into a ghost east of town...let me tell you it was
eerie!"  The frog then hops away to join his friends....
