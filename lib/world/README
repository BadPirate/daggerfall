CircleMUD 3.0 - World Files, Beta Version 11
furry@circlemud.org

   Contained in this lovely archive is the present shape of the
world for Circle 3.0.  I have put everything into ascii flags
for easy addition and removal of flags.  I have also finally
gotten around to changing all the shops to the new versions
(they make good examples since I tried to include a bit of
everything, from wandering shops to shops that don't like
certain alignments or classes)  I would like to get some
feedback on the work I've done thus far... ie... do you like
it?  Don't you?  Why do/don't you like it?  That kind of
thing.  Also, if it is at all possible, could you email me
your typos (and possibly bugs for world bugs) file so that I
can correct those problems before the Gamma release of Circle
3.0.

   The zone files have been reformatted so that each has comments
(my style of commenting, so that I know what is s'posed to be
going on (= )  All the wld files have been properly indented to
three spaces in (for consistency mostly and it was easier re-doing
about a third of the descripts...)  A couple of areas have been
shifted around and there have been a few area additions so far with
the potential of more to come (see if you can figure out what they
are, shouldn't be too hard (= )  Many typos and 'bugs' have been 
corrected thus far, but I'm sure that more exist yet, so please
send me a listing of the ones you find.

   I thank you for your time, and please direct all comments to:

Also, please note the 'zone.lst' file in this directory, which shows
all of the zone numbers that are in use, and what is using them.
Finally, full credit should be in all of the zone files (please
leave it there in case you ever release your mud code and world),
and can also be found in 'info.hlp' under 'AREAS ZONES' which gives
a current list of zones used in CircleMUD.  Please ensure that all
credits in there remain, and if you add new areas, please credit
them properly.
