The Beginning of the &yYellow Brick Road&n~
   The yellow brick road starts in the middle of nowhere.  After three turns
around its beginning, it branches off in three seperate roads heading west,
north, and east.  The road to the north leads to a castle.  The road to the
west leads to a beatiful chapel.  And the road to the east leads into a series
of very odd-looking buildings.

The &yYellow Brick Road&n~
   The yellow brick road is finely made and magical by nature.  It glows a warm
mellow yellow against the bright green grass of the field.  The field is
spotted with several different kinds of wild flowers.  To the west and north, a
beautiful chapel rises up out of the grass.  Its stained glass windows form a
different rainbow from the flowers.  The yellow brick road's beginning lies to
the east.

The &yYellow Brick Road &CBefore the Chapel&n~
   The brick of the road is laid so close to each other that its surface
appears to be completely seamless when one runs a hand across it.  The grass
grows neatly on either side, but makes no attempt to infringe on the road
itself.  A beautiful chapel made of pure white marble and glorious stained
glass windows rises up to the north.  To the east, the road trails past a small
castle and on into a series of buildings.

The &yYellow Brick Road&n~
   The yellow road marches through the grass in anything but a straight line.
It looks like it was made by drunks!  The bricks themselves are neatly laid,
but there is little reason for the road to wander the way it does on such a
flat field.  A little shop pops up out of the grass to the north.  The road
itself runs in a vague west/east direction.  There is a small but well worn
path that winds around behind the shop to the northwest.

A Loop in the &yYellow Brick Road&n~
   The yellow brick road turns around in a great big loop as it heads in a
general east and west direction.  There is no real reason for it to do so but
it loops nonetheless.  The emerald green grass grows to either side of the road
and forms a little island inside the loop.

The &yYellow Brick Road&n~
   This is not so much a shopping center as a shopping blob.  Three
different-colored yellow roads converge on one spot and simple splatter
outward, forming an irregular shape.  The road to the north is a pale yellow.
The road to the west is a rich yellow-gold.  And the road to the south is a
deep goldenrod.  A yellow stairway walks up into thin air and stops when it
reaches a huge box shape that floats in the sky.

The &yGoldenrod Brick Road&n~
   The road is a deep goldenrod color with flashes of a rich orange every now

manhole leading down into the sewer.  The building to the west is covered with
cheap mage globes, half of which have burned out.  The building to the south is
made of rough lava rock and smells of sulfur.  The building to the east would
be perfectly normal if it didn't look like it had been built upside down.

   The road is made of pale stone and wanders from side to side as if it is not
quite sure where it is going or what it should do when it gets there.  A small
stand made of braided straw and cobwebs has been set up in the middle of the
street.  It also has a counter made of solid marble.  The air is filled with
the smell of coffee from the cafe to the east and pastries from the stand.  
Another store made of sandblasted glass is to the west.  The road runs north

are tables and chairs made of cold iron with bright red silk umbrellas on top.
The sun shines brightly down on the shrubs and flowers that have been carefully
cultivated all around.  Inside Dremor's Jop is soothing darkness and the quiet
sounds of an unseen violin being played.  The chairs and tables are made from
darkly stained oak.  The yellow brick road is to the west of Dremor's Jop.

more normal-looking if the rock were not a bright green color.  The road falls

Entrance to Ethreal Street~
   You are standing on, or in Ethreal Street, this whole street is enveloped
and surrounded by swirling colorful gases.  The way you used to get here
appears to be no longer existant.  So the only way to return how would be to
have your city call you home (&rRecall&n).  To the east the street wanders on,
maybe you'll find what you are looking for, but I doubt it.    
  You hear the sound of rolling dice and buzzers coming off from the west.
  Above you is the auctioning block, where auctioneers go after transacting.

Main Street~
   You continue your walk along mainstreet..  Either side of the street is
lined with a big building, what you might recognize as a few guild houses.  
The street gets narrow and croweded as you are still near the heart of the
city.  You can continue west towards Guild Street, or head back east down
mainstreet

Thieves Guildroom~
   You are standing in the guild of thieves, you instinctivly grab at your
pouch but are glad to find that as far as you know nothing is missing.  You see
a lot of dummies with bells on them hanging from the ceiling, and thieves
ducking in and out, creating diversions and picking the pockets of the dummies
without ringing the bells.  Some are better than others and you think that some
should have been warriors.  There is a sign here detailing when your master
will teach you skills.

Scout Guildroom~
   You you barely recognize anyone in the room and are about to leave when
people start appearing seemingly from nothing; camoflage spots on the walls,
welcoming you into their guild.  The scouts seem very welcoming, and trusting,
but all seem to have their own agendas below their calm smiles.  There is a
sign on the wall listing what you can get and when the master will teach it to
you.

The lift~
   This small, old lift takes you up to the second floor of the conglomeration.
The lift looks pretty old, but you can clearly tell that it has been kept up
pretty nicely.  The ropes used to move up and down look worn down, but they do
not look like they are ready to break yet.  You can go down, to return to the
main room, or you can continue on to your personal room.

&rYOU HAVE DIED!!!&n

   It would seem that even though you have died, you may still have a chance at
the small possessions you had in life.  A demon stands here smiling as your
equipment is about to mean his profit.  The shopkeeper has all of your
equipment and that of many others whom have walked the wrong path, right into
their bloody end.  All you have to do is be able to afford his price and you
can go on your merry way.  Otherwise, you might as well just (&rRecall&n)

The &bMain &rArena &bEntrance&n~
   Above you is the Arena.  Where all the great warriors go to fight and kill
each other.  Only there can they do it without really being killed.  It's more
of a game.  A test of strength and weaponry.  In other words, it's just a place
for people who are stuck on themselves to show off.

arena sign~
Here's what happens when you die normally...
You're killed, you lose exp, your eq is put in a corpse, and your sent to hell

However when you die in the arena...

You're killed, your sent to hell with all your eq on you

When an official arena is going on, you can earn exp from beating up people,
and for each person you kill in an official arena you get 1 arena token, which
you can gamble away in attempts at a &rred token&n at the gamble master.  Also
there can be other prizes for the champion of an arena, as well as everyone who
participates gets a full heal when they die.  So there is no pentalty for losing
and there is plenty of opportunities to win, even if you are the weakest person
on the mud, you can still try to get into the bigger fights for the chance of a
kill blow.

However when an official arena is not going, any battles in the arena don't give
you exp, and don't give you a full heal when your done, however they still don't
take away exp when you die, and you don't have to collect eq

&bSO PLAY IN THE ARENA TODAY!&n

The Sewage Dump~
   There is a few shoots on all the sides of this wonderful place that
occasionally people come shooting out of into the muck that surrounds you.  
This is where the gods flush their garbage when they are done speaking with
them, and it is recommended that you crawl out before you pick up some kind of
permanant odor.  If you haven't already that is.

And there are beautiful lounge chairs on both sides of the room.

Armitage and Connavar's Abode~
   The room is a confused room.  As you look around you see a divide in the
room, ac ross which a battle is being fought.  On one side, there is a land of
chaos and death.  Weapons number in there thousands and various preserved human
body parts decorate the scene as trophies of battles won.  On the other side a
state of pure calm exists, it is well ordered and only the real necessities
take up the space.  Incense burns in the corner purifying the air of hate that
rules the world.
