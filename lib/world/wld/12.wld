The Conference Room~
   Upon entering this you can hear faint talking.  You must have stumbled apon
the meeting room of the Gods.  When you enter, everyone is quit and glares at
you, as if you dont belong here.  A while later they ignore you and go back to
work.

The Workshop~
   This is the Builders' Room.  This is where the immortals of Daggerfall come
and post and talk about their zones and coding.  They come here and post their
ideas/doings on the board that hangs on the wall here.  All along here there
are book shelves filled with books on how to build zones.  In the corner there,
almost unnoticed, there is a small TV playing a video on building made e-z.

The Gods' Mortal Board Room~
   As you stand here in this toom, a strange feeling comes apon you.  It is
almost as if you remember something.  Dejavu is eating away at you, then you
remember the good old times being a mortal in the world of Daggerfall, comming
to the library to read the daily news and post any ideas.  Yeah, those were the
good old days.

The Living Room~
   This is a good sized room that takes up most of the first floor of the Frat
House of the Gods.  Beat up, but comfy chairs are thrown ramdomly around, with
the occasional coffee table or ottoman strewed in between.  North is the
Workshop, for all those happy builders out there.  East is the Mortal Board
room, where anyone who cares can read the mort's whining posts.  South is the
very dusty, little used Conference Room.  West is Mail Room, how exciting!  
Don't you just love getting mail?  A staircase near the back of the room leads
up to the bedrooms, and a creaky staircase leads down into the basement.  
Don't go down if you are a mere mortal!  &rDEATH&n will come to you!  I would
choose northwest, personally.

The Mail Room~
   This is the post office of the Gods.  In here is a counter in the center of
the room dividing it in half.  On the other side is the post office attendant.
He looks very disturbed and frusterated.  On the west wall there is a small
sign displaying the price of the mail here.  All around the post office
attendant there are piles and piles of mail, all over the place, but on the
side you are on it is very clean.

The Dusty Attic~
   Here you stand, In the mighty social gathering room of the Gods of
Daggerfall.  This is the room where the gods come and do the little socializing
they may feel like doing.  On the wall, looking at the board, it appears as if
there is little or no messages on it.  Goes to show how much socializing they
do.

Galvanon's Galvanized Domain, without the Zinc~
This room seems cold and desolate.  The walls and floors are all made of solid
titanium - it has been said that nothing gets in or out of this room without
terrible loss.  The ceiling is made of pure gold, but it doesn't help the
ominous gray atmosphere that overshadows the area.  A slight
chill can be felt as you walk through this hall, probably due to the massive
amount of metal used - and the metal drains heat away VERY rapidly.

&bThe Ice Box&n~
   &bThis is a very cold room.  So cold it freezes the blood in your veins.  
To be in here, you must have done something wrong and gotten transported here
by a god.  This is the punishment room for all the bad mortals, and sometimes
gods that have done wrong.  You are stuck on here with no way out, unless some
immortal feels you have had enough punishment.

The Immortal Corpse Room~
   Death, torture, stench, These words come to mind apon entering this room.  
It is almost as if a morgue, with all the filecabnet-like storages for the dead
bodies.  It has a very terrible stench to it, and seals off to the exit above
you do the immortals dont have to put up with the smell.  There are candles
apon the walls, about one every five feet, keeping this large room very well
lighted.  As you look around, you notice a little demon run up to you and ask
if he can help you, as almost if you were inside a shop.  He asks if you need
to identify any bodys or if you can help him.  Then he turns and goes back to
work.

The Basement~
   Water drips and the noise echoes through the cold, damp basement that you
have just entered.  Cracked pavement is the only wall there is, shielded only
by the damp, sagging boxes that are used for storage.  Beneath your feet lies
the heavy door leading to the old-fashioned ice box, dug deep within the earth.
When you try loking in the cardinal directions, a strange haze is all you see.
To the north, is a wavering temple.  The south holds a giant tree.  To the east
is a majestic parthenon.  The west shows a statue of a gorgeous dragon.  Very
strange...  &rREAD THE MAP!!!!!!!!!!&n

Gad's Praxeum~
   A simple, plain room lies before you.  A desk covered with papers and ther
miscellaneous things sits in the corner of the room.  The walls and floor look
quite the same, the shadows are the only sign that they meet, otherwise one
might assume the wall was the floor and walk right into it.  The only thing
disturbing the smooth contours of the room is a small window on the far wall.
Through it one can see the whole realm.  A telescope sitting beside it makes it
easier to see the details.  No mortal knows where this room lies.  It is said
that it lies within a cloud, but no one knows for sure.  You could look up from
the realms at the many clouds and never know which is the one Gad calls his
praxeum.  No exits lead away from the room.  No sounds are heard.  Only a place
for Gad to look upon the world and change it as he sees fit.  It is said that
he meditates in this room as well, but no one knows for sure.

     This is a place where the threads of reality are twisted and
contorted by Xander to make anything he pleases.  At times this 
place appears as a magnificent den, other times it is the peak of
a mountain, and sometimes is even underwater.  The very walls twist
as if being tortured by some malevolent force...this is Xander's
mind...

   This is Striker's thinking room, where he goes to shut out the noise of the
outside world and do his deep thought.  Isn't used very often, though.  So to
make up for not thinking much, he also uses it as his place to trans players
and yell at them.  The room is plain white, and the door is too, so you can't
tell which way leads out of the room.  You may be here for a while...  There's
a red sign here, too.  What's it say?

A Rose Garden~
   Giant black roses as large as a giant's head form a border around the
garden.  White roses with blushing red centers are next, sprinkled with the
occasional daisy.  Poppies and oriental grasses grow in the pillars of pots
that arch overhead and meet in the middle of the garden.  White flowers with
long, twisted petals twine their vines about the fountain.  A path of stone
circles spiral inward around the fountain.
