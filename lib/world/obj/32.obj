   The silver button is rather primitive.  The hammer marks from its making
still show in its surface and the holes cut into it are crude and unsmoothed.
Yet, the silver is shiny and untarnished.  A grey shimmer moves beneath its

lightens to a bloody ruby color at the leaf tips.  The flower itself is a
tear-shaped black petal with two long, narrow petals curling downward and back
to the stem.  The stamen of the flower are the same color as the leaves.
