My Lady Cockatryce,
Something evil is afoot in my kingdom!  Knowing your propensity
for helping the helpless, I am turning to you for help.  The
annual Festival of the Banana is coming up in my kingdom.  My 
gardeners and harvesters have worked very hard to grow me a bunch
of bananas that are bigger and tastier than any others for the
highlight of the festival.  Unfortunately, today, on the eve of
the festival, they have been stolen!  Please find the perpetrator,
bring him to justice, and return to my bananas to me!  I'm sure it
is my rival, the rogue Chimpanzee King.  Thank you.

Kindest regards,
The Monkey King
