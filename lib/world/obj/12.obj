obsidian dress~
   The material is silky smooth to the touch.  It has a nice scoop neckline
with spaghetti straps and practically no back.  Black discs of metal have been
sewn down the length of a small section of the skirt.  They twinkle like
mirrors.

sculpture fountain woman~
   Long locks of hair with streaks of silver sheen running through it snake
down her back.  Her face is beautifully arrogant with eyes a bit too large for
a human and extremely pointed ears.  Black fangs just barely show through her
full lips.  Water falls from a shallow bowl she holds into the fountain's
basin.  The folds of her obsidian dress cover the bottom of the basin and
contrast sharply with its pure white marble.
