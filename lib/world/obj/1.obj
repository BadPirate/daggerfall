three 3~
   7.  3.  00- Wyvern floor finished.  Basement started, have basement and

four 4~
   7.  10.  00- Brodie has added 12 rooms, 2 healers, 1 weapon, 1 armor, 1
fountain, 1 shopkeeper, and all clan EQ.  His mortal has been added to clan,
also.  Possible promotion in future.  Clan funds continue to fluctuate due to
high spending and midlevel accumulation.

five 5~
   7.  11.  00- Getting frustrated.  No funds are coming in so far.  With armor
