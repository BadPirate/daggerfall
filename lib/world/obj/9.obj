boat leaky old decrepit~
   Its boards are badly warped and peeling away from the frame.  An attempt has
been made to fill the gaps with pitch, but the boat will probably leak all over
the place.  Only the very desperate would use such an unworthy craft.

grass monk yellow flower~
   The flower's petals grow in such a way that it looks like a man dressed in
robes, praying.  Perhaps this that is why this plant is known as the &yyellow
&Ymonk&n.  Herbalists once believed yellow monk to be the cure for swamp fever,
but no one catches the fever now and so this cannot be proven.

jewel dark smoky~
   The dark jewel has been carefully cut to reflect the most light possible.  
It's more smoky than black.  Very similar to obsidian, yet it is far too
brilliant to be mere glass.  There's something menacing about this rock.  It's
as if it hates you.

bush candle flower~
   The candle bush blooms at night.  During the day, its long, pale flowers are
closed tightly, but at night their sweet scent fills the air.  The long, pale
yellow stamen of the candle bush's flower looks like a candle wick.  Candle
bushes have the sweetest smelling blossoms in the forest.  Unfortunately, the
blossoms do not last long if they are picked.

   According to the legend of the &rRed Baron&n, this plant bore no blossoms up
until the day of his death at the Battle of Black Forest.  The last drop of
blood from the Baron's heart turned into a flower and it has been called &rred
baron&n ever since.  The flower's petals overlap to form a perfect circular
shape around the flower's red center.
