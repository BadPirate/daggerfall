an old tarnished key~
A rusty old key is resting here, slowly fading away.~
This key has definatly seen better days.  After years of being outside,
the rust has weakened the key making it very brittle.  Be careful not to
break it.

Beware my friend, I am writing this note with the last of my strength
for the vile creatures here have wounded me beyond healing.  So I leave
you with what knowledge I have gained.  I hate to leave you a riddle,
but it is the only way to ensure that it will not fall into the wrong
hands.

     "Color is both a key and an answer to the riddle..."
     "Youth holds the knowledge that you seek..."

Signed,

&Rthe Bla&rde of Apo&Kcalypse&n~
Laying here is a wicked looking sword that was made to slay creatures of evil.~
Guarded for centuries the blade has laid hidden far below the surface
waiting for the right hero to come and reclaim it.  The sparkling jeweled
hilt is wrapped in a tight silken rope which stops at the platinum cross-
guard.  The blade is made of black adamantite, and is virtually incapable
of being destroyed.  The jagged flame-shaped blade is razor sharp, and
the light gleams on its surface.
