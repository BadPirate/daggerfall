tiamat dragon doll~
   The &MTiamat&n doll is an astonishingly life-like replica of the real
dragon.  Hard, jewel-like scales adorn the doll's leathery hide.  Four heads
balanced on four long necks emerge from the body.  The heads are four different
colors, yellow for Air, green for Earth, red for Fire, and blue for Water.  
The bulk of her body is yellow.  Fortunately, this doll can't kill you, as the
real thing can.

   This model of a beautiful cat is petite and perfectly made.  He has long,
silky hair that seems to be real.  Most of his back and tail are black, except
for a white collar around his neck and a strip of white up his left hind leg.
A white blaze runs down his nose, and from there on down, the rest of his face
is white.  His legs, belly, and throat are all white as well.  He has a
leathery pink nose, and bright yellow glass eyes.

phoenix doll~
   This small doll is shaped in the figure of a man.  He has orangey-red hair,
and crystal-clear blue eyes.  He isn't very handsome, but his face has a
strange way of drawing the eye.  He looks a bit thin and scrawny, yet is
clothed in brilliant, shining armor, and carries a gleaming sword.  What a
strange doll!
